remarked of her ex-boyfriend, Gabriel Glenn.&nbsp;But time and tide take their toll on the finest and worst among us, as well as everyone in between.&nbsp;Jackson and Glenn split up amicably after dating for two years.</p><h2>Paris Jackson Breakup</h2><p>In August 2020, TMZ revealed the news of the separation.&nbsp;According to a source close to the famed performer’s daughter, the split was amicable, and neither side harbored ill will toward the other.&nbsp;In the couple’s Facebook Watch series Unfiltered: Paris Jackson and Gabriel Glenn (via People), which aired its last episode soon after their split was announced, Jackson said that Glenn is “one of many soulmates” for her.</p><p><img decoding=async

style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“I don’t believe soulmates are merely romantic partners,” she said.&nbsp;She said that one might have several relationships with one’s soulmate over the course of numerous lives.</p><h2>Paris Jackson is swooning over her boyfriend Gabriel Glenn.</h2><p>Jackson spoke lyrically about her lover in the same docuseries. “He helps me feel less alone. He’s had an effect on me, my life, and my heart in ways I can’t even begin to articulate. I cannot imagine my existence without him.”&nbsp;The boyfriend mentioned an agreement the pair had made early in their relationship, almost as if he was forecasting the split even then.</p><p>“I remember saying when we initially got together that even if we didn’t work out as a relationship, we’d always want to be in a band together,” he said. “Music was something we wanted to keep no matter what.”</p><p>According to TMZ, Jackson was the one who initiated the separation.&nbsp;The insider also confirmed that the relationship ended because it had run its course and that the split was, in some ways, unavoidable.&nbsp;However, just because the divorce was amicable does not imply that everything went well.</p><h2>Paris Jackson’s Most Heartbreaking Loss</h2><p>During an interview on Red Table Talk with Willow Smith, Jackson stated that her two-year breakup with her lover was the greatest pain she had ever experienced.&nbsp;Despite this, she said that she had discovered her most powerful rebirths as a result of her grief. She discovered her voice. Despite the fact that Jackson began learning music and songwriting at an early age, she never truly performed or recorded her craft until Glenn.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Paris-Jackson-3.jpg alt="Paris Jackson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“It was the most intense affection I’d ever felt for someone. It was the most intense I’d ever felt “She said. “It was the most profound betrayal I’d ever felt.”</p><p>This grief inspired Jackson to pursue a career as a musician.&nbsp;Even though she was still a bit afraid to perform to the standards established by her late father, she was more positive that her father would be proud of the lady she’d become.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmqqZqHqrrcKkqqimXai1or7EnWStoJGpeqmx0WaZq52RoMKxedaiq6FlmJq%2FbrjOr5yrZaeWwG7Ax55knZ2VpbK0wIyhnJqqpJe%2Fpq3KZqqhnV2aw6a%2BjKGYnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sza-went-to-life-coach-thinking-they-were-therapist-8383979.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>SZA Accidentally Went to a 'Life Coach' Thinking They Were a Therapist</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./o-j-mcduffie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | O.J.
