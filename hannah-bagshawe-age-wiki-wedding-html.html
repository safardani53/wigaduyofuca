Hannah Bagshawe's Wiki-Like Bio: Age, Parents, Birthday, Height, Job & Net Worth</strong></h3><p>On 30 November 1982, Hannah Bagshawe was born to parents Nicholas Bagshawe and Caryl Bagshawe, in London.

Hannah Met Eddie At High School, Was Friend For 12 Years Before Becoming Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Hannah met her future husband, British actor, Eddie Redmayne, long before they started dating. While Eddie attended Eton College in Eton, Berkshire, Hannah studied in a local girl’s college. The two met and befriended each other during a charity event Hannah and her friends organized; this happened in the year 2000.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>For the next twelve years, Hannah and Eddie remained friends but were not a couple. Things, however, changed in 2012, when Eddie invited Hannah on a trip to Florence, Italy. The couple started dating after that, and only two years later, they were engaged to be married. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3><strong>3. Hannah & Eddie's Wedding Quirks: Winter Theme, Late Bride</strong></h3><p>Eddie and Hannah’s wedding, though intimate and attended by fewer people, was nothing sort of fantastic. It was the Winter Wonderland themed wedding at the historic Babington House in Somerset.</p><p>According to Eddie, the couple liked the In The Bleak Midwinter, and a winter wedding was the perfect place to do so.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>What Is Tim Baker's Age?

But Eddie, knowing Hannah as well as he did, wasn’t concerned and thought nothing of it since, according to him, Hannah “&nbsp;has never been on time for anything in her life.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3><strong>4. Hannah Keeps Eddie Redmayne A Family Man Despite His Career Heights</strong></h3><p>Eddie Redmayne might be one of the most acclaimed actors today, but it seems as if his fame is useless for his married life and family. Apparently, as Eddie himself puts it, Hannah keeps him grounded.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>There was a moment yesterday where I was in rehearsal and my wife was calling me because our dishwasher broke down … So in the process of trying to focus on my craft, I was dealing with the blocked pipes.</p><p>It looks as if Hannah drags him back to the grounds of the everyday family life when he is flying high as an&nbsp;actor in the lights of Hollywood fame.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Daughter Turns Two</strong>: Hannah & Eddie have already enjoyed four years of marriage and two years of parenthood (photo: Eddie's Instagram)</p><p>Moreover, the couple has two children now (a daughter, Iris Mary Redmayne, born on 15 June 2016, and a son,&nbsp;Luke Richard Bagshawe, born very recently on 10 March 2018) to keep Eddie a family man.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Another Celebrity Partner:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Sam Asghari, Britney Spears' Boyfriend Wiki: Age, Family, Job, Net Worth</a></p><p>In the fourth years of their marriage, and with two little young uns, Hannah and Eddie seem&nbsp;to be on the right path in their life.
