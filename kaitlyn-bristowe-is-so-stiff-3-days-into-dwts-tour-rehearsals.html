After winning season 29 of <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong> </a>is taking her talents on the road with the cast — and the former Bachelorette is already feeling the pain.</p><p>“The pros have actually been rehearsing much longer than myself, which I don’t think is fair. I’m like, ‘They’re not the ones that need the rehearsal time. I do!’” Bristowe, 36, exclusively told Us Weekly while promoting the tour. “I’ve been rehearsing for the last three days and I really prepped to go on Dancing With the Stars — I was, like, training, I was going to physio, I was doing all the things. And I kind of threw myself back into this forgetting how intense it was. My body is so stiff just from three days, my neck is already, like, I pulled something.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kaitlyn-Bristowe-So-Stiff-3-Days-Into-DWTS-Tour-Rehearsals-001.jpg><p>The “Off the Vine” podcast host took home the mirror ball with <a href=#><strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong></a> during the 2020 season of the ABC competition, which didn’t feature group dances due to <a href=#>coronavirus protocols</a>.</p><p>“It is so fun feeling the energy of all the pros and dancing together, and it already feels like we’re one big family, having so much fun together,” Bristowe continued. ”It’s such a different energy dancing with everyone. And I can’t wait for people to come watch the tour.”</p><p>Season 29 also didn’t include <a href=#>an audience in the ballroom</a>.</p><p>“I’m so excited because I think [a crowd] just changes the whole dynamic of the energy. I got to do that one <a href=#><strong>Janet Jackson</strong></a> dance to <a href=#>announce that I was going on tour</a> and just hearing people cheer in the crowd — it’s a game-changer,” Bristowe explained, noting that she feels similarly about her podcast tour. “It’s just a whole other ballgame.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kaitlyn-Bristowe-So-Stiff-3-Days-Into-DWTS-Tour-Rehearsals-002.jpg><p>The host added that she’s been told that the 2022 tour, which also includes season 30 winner <a href=#><strong>Iman Shumpert</strong></a>, is “different” from past live shows.</p><p>“There’s just gonna be a lot of different elements to this show and there’s so much jam-packed into one show that, like, you’re really gonna get your bang for your buck if you come,” she told Us. “You’re gonna see it all, you’re gonna see everybody.”</p><p>Before hitting the road in January 2022, Bristowe will cohost the live After the Final Rose with <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a> when <a href=#><strong>Michelle Young</strong></a>’s season of The Bachelorette concludes on Tuesday, December 21. “I’m so scared,” she admitted about the taping before laughing. “Kaitlyn on live national television – what could go wrong?”</p><p>She’s also in the middle of planning her wedding to fiancé <a href=#><strong>Jason Tartick</strong></a> — but leaving most of the details to her wedding planner.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They’re a lifesaver when it comes to this. … I wanted a wedding planner no matter what because I am not a good decision maker with wedding stuff,” Bristowe explained. “Like I wanna say, ‘I don’t really care about the flowers,’ but maybe I do once I see them, I don’t know. I just want somebody to make it the perfect day and I just wanna show up and enjoy what marriage and [a] wedding is really supposed to be. … It’s gonna be up to the wedding planner to really take the reins on this while I’m gone. And Jason, but he’s so busy too.”</p><p>Tickets for Dancing With the Stars Live 2022 are available now at <a href=#>dwtstour.com.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKaoaShxq95waugrKyfrLJutdJmqqhlo6m2p7KMbGSdmamoeqq606hkna%2BkqHq1u9SrZKudmJqus7%2FApapo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./queen-cheryl-e46m-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Queen Cheryl (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-duggar-petitions-us-supreme-court-to-overturn-child-pornography-conviction.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Duggar Petitions US Supreme Court to Overturn Conviction</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
