Baker, DMD. "These side effects are greatly reduced when people use teeth whitening pens, because the concentration of the active ingredient that makes the tooth lighter is lower than professional whitening. They really do work and I recommend them for patients who suffer with teeth sensitivity.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed to create immediate and lasting results, whitening pens don’t whiten as drastically as in-office whitening sessions or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>teeth whitening strips</a>, but they’re far more convenient — just apply the gel to your teeth, wait 30 to 60 seconds, and then either rinse or let the product dissolve on its own, revealing a brighter smile.The thin brush tips allow for a more precise application that can penetrate hard-to-reach crevices between teeth for a more uniformly brightened smile. “The major benefit of using a whitening pen is the convenience factor," adds Dr. Shahira Saad, DDS. "It can easily be carried around in your pocket or purse for frequent on-the-go touch-ups.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you find the best teeth whitening pen for your needs, we tested 13 products from the top brands on the market both in our lab and at home. Over several weeks, we evaluated their effectiveness, noting their ease of use, any sensitivity or lingering taste, and keeping in mind their practicality for on-the-go touch-ups. We also kept in mind overall value for each product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the best teeth whitening pens to help you achieve a more luminous, pearly white smile, including products designed to instantly brighten, those made for sensitive teeth, and more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-viebeauti-teeth-whitening-pen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>VieBeauti Teeth Whitening Pen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="VieBeauti Teeth Whitening Pen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1d3BW6JjNqSahpvBPzPNIl2gQ_0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/71KwajKgj7L._SL1500_-112564930a3549689c51acf4f7b8213b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Convenience</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>It noticeably brightened our teeth after one week of consistent use.</p></li><li readability=0><p>There’s no need to rinse or brush your teeth after use, so it’s great for taking on the go.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It takes less than 1 minute to use from start to finish.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The pen leaves teeth feeling fresh and clean, rather than sticky or gooey.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of all the teeth whitening pens we tested, VieBeauti’s product was the clear winner thanks to its intuitive instructions, quick and fuss-free application, overall value, and most notably, the dramatic results we saw in just one week. We used all three pens included in this value pack over the course of several weeks, noticing a distinctly brighter smile after just a few days — by the end of our testing period, our teeth were a full two shades whiter.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you’ll need to brush your teeth before using this pen, there’s no need to brush or rinse afterwards, making this a fast and convenient product for touch-ups on the go. We loved that it didn’t leave any sticky residue in our mouths — in fact, it felt more like that after-dentist clean feeling. While we felt a mild tingling sensation when we accidentally applied some on our gums, it didn’t cause any other lingering discomfort or sensitivity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s incredibly straightforward to use: You simply twist the cap until the gel appears, then apply it to your teeth and wait for 30 seconds before it dissolves. It’s mess-free and fits easily in a purse, making this a great travel companion that you can pull out on the go.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Given that there are three pens included in this kit, we also found it to be an excellent value, as they each go a long way — particularly for anyone looking to use this primarily for touch ups, rather than for twice-a-day use over an extended period of time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>35% carbamide peroxide |<strong> Treatment Length:</strong> 30 seconds, twice daily</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-runner-up-best-overall-philips-zoom-whitening-pen-525-hp-1-pen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Runner-up, Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Philips Zoom Whitening Pen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Philips Zoom Whitening Pen 5.25% HP (1 Pen)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/sz9V_V16162mz_cbXjzCjvJxjcc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/philips-zoom-whitening-pen-525-hp-39c7d8e979ff409b94b134ebff0b7d8c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Convenience</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>We noticed shinier teeth after one use, and visibly brighter teeth after one week.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s easily portable and a great value purchase.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Philips is a highly trusted and widely used brand.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a pen with all of the same positive attributes as our top pick, but from one of the most trusted and recognizable name brands in dental care, then the Philips Zoom Whitening Pen is for you. It’s portable and compact, making it a practical addition to any purse or gym bag for on-the-go touch-ups.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you are required to brush your teeth first, there’s no need to do so afterwards — the gel dissolves within less than a minute, leaving teeth feeling smooth and clean. The only downside is we did notice a slight aftertaste, but it was manageable and didn’t linger long.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that a little goes a long way with this pen; after using it at least twice a day for two weeks, we still had plenty of solution leftover. It uses hydrogen peroxide to help lift stains and spots, and we noticed our teeth were shinier after just one use. After a full week of using the pen as directed, our teeth were visibly whiter and some small stains were removed entirely.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>5.25% hydrogen peroxide |<strong> Treatment Length:</strong> 60 seconds, twice daily</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-polar-teeth-whitening-polar-teeth-whitening-pen-single></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Polar Teeth Whitening Polar Teeth Whitening Pen Single</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Polar Teeth Whitening Polar Teeth Whitening Pen Single" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/udrwhIyYTvxt-q4ZFUQvtCM3pAg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/polar-teeth-whitening-polar-teeth-whitening-pen-single-ea565d7bf8ea479b93eabbdf24caaf53.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Convenience</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Our teeth were 4 shades lighter after 3 weeks of consistent use.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a pleasant minty taste that's not overpowering.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>A little goes a long way — one pen lasted us for a full month.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>The process is more time consuming, as the gel takes a longer time to set.</p></li><li readability=0><p>You need to brush the gel off after use, unlike some other whitening pens we tested.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We noticed slight gum sensitivity after using as directed for one month.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This teeth whitening pen boasts 12 percent dental grade hydrogen peroxide, which is almost double the amount included in the Philips Zoom Whitening Pen — we found that it drastically whitened our teeth (a full 4 shades!) after 3 weeks of use. Our dentist even commented that our teeth were looking brighter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the higher percentage of the active whitening agent did cause some slight gum sensitivity after regular use, we didn’t find it too painful — certainly less so than what you would experience after a professional whitening session.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our biggest hangup was that the gel requires 60 seconds to dry, and then an additional hour to set before brushing it off. If you’re looking for a more portable option, we’ve got plenty of other convenient products on this list. But for those with room to incorporate this into their morning or bedtime routine, the time commitment will pay off with a brighter smile in less than a month. Plus, it’s an excellent value purchase, as the pen lasted us a full month. We appreciated that the clear tube also allowed us to keep an eye on how much solution was left inside, so we knew when we were due for a refill.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>12% hydrogen peroxide |<strong> Treatment Length:</strong> 60 minutes, once daily</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-invisalign-invisalign-whitening-pen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Invisalign</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Invisalign Whitening Pen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Invisalign Whitening Pen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/CsHq3ykY8f2ufKnQkXjvoNQ-NTw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/invisalign-whitening-pen-63005375b7fb4338af1329c6a4e8f7eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Invisalign&nbsp;</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Convenience</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>The gel leaves a slightly tacky residue on teeth for a few moments after use.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The pen is opaque, so you can’t see how much product you have left.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Invisalign users are already on their way to a straighter smile, so why not double down and whiten your teeth at the same time? This gel is small and compact, making it easy to bring along to the office or on vacation.

However, the minty aftertaste may not appeal to everyone, and you may prefer to spit it out to avoid discomfort from swallowing it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Hydrogen peroxide |<strong> Treatment Length:</strong> 45-60 seconds, two to four times daily</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-26 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Smileactives Teeth Whitening Pen" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/aHUJtjspY47jKe5zaM3QkGsWbvc=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-detail-smileactives-teeth-whitening-pen-jjuliao-11421-02a9ffb45bbf4ebab566157a961380bb.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Smileactives Teeth Whitening Pen" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Rd7tXXUx68U6vae46xQcxjiL5K4=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-detail-smileactives-teeth-whitening-pen-jjuliao-11422-cbdfb972257444e2bf9de2a5d2724cbf.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-rinse-free-glo-science-glo-to-go-teeth-whitening-pen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Rinse-Free</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>GLO Science GLO To Go Teeth Whitening Pen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="GLO Science GLO To Go Teeth Whitening Pen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qsY3RTbcQa59etMHAUr-6mTk0mk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/glo-science-glo-to-go-teeth-whitening-pen-87925b2dd35b45178498cb7dd37067d0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>GLO Science</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Convenience</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>The rubber-tipped applicator may not appeal to everyone, but we’ve got plenty of brush options elsewhere on this list.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You need to wait 20 minutes to eat or drink after use.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This button-base applicator couldn’t be easier to use — just click, apply, and you’re good to go!

Hydrogen peroxide is known to cause less sensitivity, as it breaks down into water and oxygen after application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Carbamide peroxide (a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and urea) is frequently used but contains higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, which can create more dramatic results but also cause slightly more discomfort.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Others rely on more natural ingredients, including coconut oil —&nbsp;but still require some form of peroxide. “Beware of many ‘whitening’ products on the market that work by acting as an abrasive (i.e. charcoal toothpaste) which can be damaging to your enamel, or ‘all-natural’ products which don’t contain the necessary peroxide ingredient,” Dr. Saad says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Applicator</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gentle bristle-brushes are typically used in teeth whitening pens, as they are slim and flexible enough to aid with more precise application. These help to ensure the gel is comfortably and evenly distributed across each tooth. Silicone applicators are another option, however, they don’t offer as much precision and can cause slightly more discomfort for those with sensitive teeth or gums.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Overall Value</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While all teeth whitening pens are generally compact and portable, the amount of gel inside can vary, and in turn can affect how often you’ll need to re-purchase them.

We received expert guidance from New York City-based cosmetic dentist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Lena Varone, DMD, FIADFE</a>, in planning out our rigorous testing steps.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In order to test each teeth whitening pen in our lab, we took careful note of their “before” teeth shade in accordance with a standard dental shade guide. Before beginning the whitening process, we noted whether or not the instructions required us to brush our teeth first. After, we carefully applied the provided gel to our teeth, paying close attention to how comfortable and intuitive it felt to hold the pen in our hand during use. Then, we allowed the gel to set for the recommended amount of time before rinsing it or allowing it to dissolve, per the instructions.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After the first round of testing, we noted any lingerie sensitivity or discomfort, as well as if there was any sticky gel residue left in our mouths.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To see how the pens would work in the real world, we then tested the pens at home daily for the remainder of the testing period, making careful observations about any changes in shade or sensitivity along the way. After our testing period, we rated each whitening pen on a scale of one to five, with five performing the highest. The 10 pens with the top average scores made this list and earned the PEOPLE Tested seal of approval.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-8023ed53-0df6-4807-816b-64c872a57276></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do teeth whitening pens really work?</span></p><p>Yes! “Teeth whitening pens can provide a more gentle alternative to professional whitening,” explains Dr. Baker, who adds that while they won’t necessarily work overnight, they can produce visible results with a bit of patience. “It may take a little longer to see results since the concentration of the active ingredient is lower, but it will still whiten teeth.” She recommends teeth whitening pens in particular for patients with teeth sensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p>“Any whitening product containing hydrogen or carbamide peroxide will whiten your teeth,” adds Dr. Saad, who notes, “the degree of whitening depends on the strength of peroxide and the modality of peroxide carrier.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are teeth whitening pens or strips better?</span></p><p>For those with sensitive teeth, whitening pens are a better choice than whitening strips as they are more gentle and use a lower concentration of active ingredients like peroxides.</p><p>“Strips are better for people who want quicker results, because the ingredients simply stay on the teeth better when there is something covering the tooth,” explains Dr. Baker. “With the gel [from the pen], it stays on the teeth but gets washed away by saliva quicker.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How quickly can yellow teeth get white again?</span></p><p>This ultimately comes down to your lifestyle, explains Dr. Baker. “Oral hygiene, diet, medications and health history all play a role in how white the teeth are,” she says. She adds that anyone who often drinks beverages or eats foods that would stain a white T-shirt — think coffee, tea, red wine, or turmeric-heavy dishes —&nbsp;will experience less drastic results using a whitening pen.</p><p>For longer-lasting results, she suggests swishing with water after you eat or drink any of those types of drinks or dishes to help prevent staining.&nbsp;</p><p>She adds that teeth can be lightened much faster with a professional in-office whitening session, which is the most effective whitening option. But for those concerned with cost or potential sensitivity, teeth whitening pens are great alternatives.</p><p>“With consistency you can achieve a white smile with whitening pens,” says Dr. Baker.&nbsp;Dr. Saad adds that “after reaching ideal brightness and assuming good oral hygiene, you can expect to need a touch up in 6 to 12 months.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sophie Dodd</a> is a PEOPLE contributor who has been writing for People.com since 2018.
