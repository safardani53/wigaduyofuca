In an interview with Nylon, she stated that she would never ever couple again with someone from the industry:</p><p>"It’s just dating people in the industry is tough. I did for a little bit. It’s hard when that’s your world. You only meet people through work and that can be really tough, because you’re not necessarily meeting people that you’re similar to. It’s just people that you’re with because you’re working on the same project.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She particularly indicated her dislike in actors, stating:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>I realize that I don’t think I like actors. Actors are really emotionally complicated. You would think they would be more in tune with their emotions, but sometimes they’re just not. I just really need to get out of this industry with someone who is in a stable environment.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Sticking to her words, she next dated someone out of the showbiz.</p><p>Two years after her breakup with Wallace, she found love again with her childhood friend from Florida, Victor Houston.

Commenting on the Twitters shaming, she issued a passionate defense of Charles saying;</p><p>I know he's not actually a bad person.
