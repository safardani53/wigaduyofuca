He was 96.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tony-Bennett-s-Family-Say-Late-Singer-Delighted-in-Making-People-Happy-in-Fan-Thank-You-294.jpg><p>Bennett’s publicist confirmed the news to the Associated Press, noting that he passed away in New York. His cause of death was not revealed at the time, but <a href=#>Bennett was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2016</a>.</p><p>“Tony left us today, but he was still singing the other day at his piano and his last song was, ‘Because of You,’ his first #1 hit,” <a href=#>Bennett’s team wrote via social media</a> on Friday. “Tony, because of you we have your songs in our heart forever. ❤.”</p><p>The legendary jazz singer, who won more than <a href=#>18 Grammy Awards</a> throughout his nearly seven-decade career, would have turned 97 on August 3.</p><p>In addition to his wife, whom he wed in 2007, Bennett is survived by his four kids from past relationships.</p><p>Bennett tied the knot for the first time in 1952, exchanging vows with an art student named <strong>Patricia Beech</strong>. That same year, he released his debut album, Because of You. The former couple welcomed sons Danny and Dae in 1952 and 1955, respectively. Bennett and Beech separated in the 1960s and finalized their divorce in 1971.</p><p>The <a href=#>“Way You Look Tonight” singer</a> moved on with <strong>Sandra Grant</strong>, whom he wed in 1971. The pair welcomed daughters Joanna and Antonia in 1970 and 1974, respectively. While Bennett and Grant split in 1979, they weren’t legally divorced until 2007.</p><p>Bennett and Benedetto subsequently said “I do,” and they were married for more than 15 years before his death.</p><p>The statement from Bennett’s family was just one of many <a href=#>mourning Bennett’s passing</a> on Friday. The musician received an outpouring of love from fellow singers and other celebrity admirers.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Rest in peace, Tony. You were the epitome of a gentleman with a God given one-of-a-kind voice,” <a href=#><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></a> captioned <a href=#>a slideshow of pics</a> of herself and Bennett over the years. “It was truly a great honor of my career and of my life to get to share the stage with you…”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Reba McEntire</strong></a> also gushed over the late singer via social media, <a href=#>writing</a>, “I had the pleasure of being around @itstonybennett twice in my career, both times at Christmas. He was a gentleman and a music icon and his voice will live on for years to come. Rest in peace, Tony.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp56ueqOxzaecrayjYsSqssRmmKecXai8r3nSqZyao12kwrV5wJ%2Brnqpdnba0ecOemK2gXaeyorCMrKuarJWisq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ty-doran.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ty Doran</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./savvy-mum-compares-bulk-buy-prices-costco-bm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Savvy mum compares the price of bulk buys at Costco and B&amp;amp;M to see which is cheaper, and the results</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
