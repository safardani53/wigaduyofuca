and a hefty new fine.</p><p>With every new year comes new beginnings, and the rules of the road are no different in this regard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mature-man-behind-steering-wheel-867692798.jpg><p>Motorists need to keep sharp of any changes on the roads in order to prevent falling foul of the rules.</p><p>Online retailer platform&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label="AutoTrader (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoTrader</a>&nbsp;has highlighted a number of <a href=#>law</a> changes which could occur next year - and some could catch more learners out when they take their test.</p><p>Whilst the rules of the road and the Highway Code change frequently, the firm warned that motorists who are not aware of alterations could face significant fines.</p><p>Nimisha Jain, motoring expert at AutoTrader, has outlined some things we're got to be wary on before going behind the wheel.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More in Motors">Read More in Motors</h2><p>Some of the new rules are nationwide, however, some are area specific and could see you slapped with a hefty fine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eyesight test</h2><p id=amp-readmore-target>While the DVSA is yet to confirm what changes will be made to the eyesight exam, many experts predict drivers might be tested in different lighting conditions.</p><p>AutoTrader claim the move could catch more learners out when they're taking their <a href=#>driving</a> test.</p><p>Nimisha said: "As part of the DVSA's plan for 2024, the eyesight test during a driving test might see some changes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>"Currently, if you can read a number plate from 20 metres away, you pass the eyesight test.</p><p>"This method of testing your eyesight might change in the future.</p><p>"The DVSA is consulting a Medical Panel on how the testing procedure should look, as well as asking drivers and experts on better ways to conduct the test."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs)</h2><p>AutoTrader also noted drivers of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) could face more stringent safety rules when driving in London from October 2024.</p><p>Transport for London (TfL) announced HGV drivers will need a safety permit before entering the UK capital, which will feature a star rating based on the vehicle's all-round visibility.</p><p>HGV driver’s will need to have a safety permit to enter Greater London and they will be marked with a star system, which will require HGV’s to be at a specific star level or face fines.</p><p>A vehicle can have a rating of zero stars (the lowest rating, with poor direct vision) up to five stars (the highest rating with excellent direct vision).</p><p>If your HGV is rated one to five stars, you can apply for a permit without the need to provide any additional evidence.</p><p>If your HGV is rated zero stars, you will need to make your vehicle safer by fitting it with Safe System improvements.</p><p>If you drive a HGV within most of Greater London without a valid permit, you may receive a penalty charge of&nbsp;up to £550.</p><p>This can be reduced to £275 if paid within 14 days.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate</h2><p>Nimisha also suggested next year could be when more UK motorists get behind the wheel of an electric car.</p><p>She continued: "From January 1, 2024 onwards, car manufacturers will need at least 22 per cent of their car sales and 10 per cent of their van sales to be fully electric under the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate which aims at increasing the sale of electric vehicles to help reduce emissions.</p><p>"The Government plans to increase this percentage of electric vehicles sold over time so that by 2030, at least 80 per cent of the cars sold are electric.</p><p>"By 2035, there are aims to have all cars sold in the UK produce zero emissions to stay in line with their ban on the sale of <a href=#>diesel</a> and petrol cars by 2035."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fuel duty freeze</h2><p>The expert also claimed 2024 could be a bad year for petrol and diesel prices as the Government might potentially end the freeze on fuel duty.</p><p>Nimisha added: "Fuel duty has been frozen since January 2011 to prevent its rise with <a href=#>inflation</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"The basic rate on diesel and petrol has been 52.95 pence per litre (ppl) as per the Office for&nbsp;Budget&nbsp;Responsibility which includes the 5ppl cut the Government has granted until the end of March 2024 to help with the cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>"In <a href=#>Spring</a> Budget 2024, we will find out more about what the Government plans to do with the fuel duty freeze and the 5ppl cut."</p><p class=postsid
