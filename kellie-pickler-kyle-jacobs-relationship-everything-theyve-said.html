As an award-winning songwriter, he and the North Carolina native often worked together on bringing her songs to life.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“[Our relationship] is really special in the fact that we get to write together and Kyle produces me and whatnot,” Pickler said during a 2017 <a href=#>episode of BUILD</a> while discussing her song “My Angel,” which was created to honor her late grandmother. “It was beautiful to see the song come to life.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Jacobs, for his part, said the track “turned out to be really special” thanks to the pair getting to collaborate with their respective mutual talents.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The couple first met in the early 2000s through a mutual friend — and the Minnesota native didn’t hesitate to boast about his talents when trying to win the Mistletoe Secret star over.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">During an interview with Us Weekly in December 2015, the duo recalled Jacobs’ first pickup line: &nbsp;“<a href=#>Hi, I’m Kyle. I’m a songwriter</a>.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">At the time, Pickler joked about her reaction, telling&nbsp;Us, “I was like, ‘Great,’” with an eyeroll. “No, we started writing the next day,” she added.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The <a href=#>lovebirds got engaged in July 2010</a>. After initially planning a large Nashville wedding, however, they decided last minute to jet off to Antigua for a low-key ceremony on New Year’s Day in 2011.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“It was perfect, because we didn’t plan anything,” Pickler told Us the following month. “I packed the wedding dress and he packed an outfit. We flew there and we didn’t know what kind of cake we were going to get. We <a href=#>didn’t know what food we were going to have</a> … it was the most incredible day of my life.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">In November 2015, they starred together in a self-described I Love Lucy reality series on CMT aptly titled I Love Kelly Pickler. Jacobs told Us at the time that the show highlighted the best aspects of their happy union.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“We love our marriage is number one, it always will be No. 1. But one of our favorite things that we can do is laugh. And we want to show that to people,” he gushed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">I Love Kellie Pickler ran for three seasons before ending in October 2017, but the couple continued to document their love for one another<a href=#> until Jacobs’ tragic death </a>in February 2023.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Keep scrolling to see everything Pickler and Jacobs have said about each other:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa4y6KcZqiZmLitsdFmorKklWK3oq%2FOm6pmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYrK3sdGyq6Ghnpx6tbTEsq2eZaOWtqV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-richards-style-evolution-her-best-looks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kyle Richards Style Evolution: Her Best Looks</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heather-terry-dubrow-are-happy-daughter-max-came-out-bisexual.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heather, Terry Dubrow Are Happy Daughter Max Came Out as Bisexual</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
