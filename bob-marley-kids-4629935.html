According to multiple reports, he was found unresponsive in a vehicle, but a cause of death was not immediately given. Joseph was a talented musician who decided to pursue music at an early age.<p id=content-paragraph-30>“I decided I wanted to do music from I was 11. Me and my cousin Daniel began to make beats with MPCs (MIDI Production Center or Music Production Controller) but I wouldn’t save them properly,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jamaica Observer</a> in 2014. “Then when I was around 12, my cousins and I went on the Melody Makers’ Roots Rock tour. Uncle Ziggy bought my cousins an Apple laptop and we used the Garage Band software and made our beats on it. We recorded from the microphone, put on our headphones and that became our studio for a good three years. That is when my songwriting started to get more focused.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>Joseph released two EPs during his music career: Comfortable in 2014 and Eternal in 2021. He also collaborated with his father, Stephen, on his 2016 song ”Revelation Party”, which was from his album Revelation Part 2: The Fruit of Life.</p><h3>Mystic Marley</h3><p id=content-paragraph-34>Mystic Marley, 26, is the sister of Joseph and was born in March of 1997.

She is inspired by her late grandfather every day, and she said she even once saw him in the clouds. “There was a moment where I literally saw his face in the cloud, and nobody could tell me it wasn’t him,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY </a>in 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-35>Adding that she always feels his presence, she said, “I feel like nature has this really beautiful way of showing itself sometimes — and even in the trees sometimes. I just, like, close my eyes and I see him, or I’m making music and I feel him.”</p><h3>Donisha Prendergast</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/donisha-bob-marley-kids-and-grandkids-mega-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-36><strong>Donisha Prendergast</strong> became an advocate for police reform after she was reported to be breaking into a southern California AirBnb she had rented while on a work trip. The eldest grandchild of Bob and Rita Marley was with two other Black colleagues and a white assistant when they were surrounded by seven police cars. “When I was ordered to put my hands up I looked at one of the policemen and said are you serious? From the first few minutes, they knew that they were wrong but there is no protocol to deescalate the situation,” she explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-37>“They never drew weapons and at no moment was I afraid; I just felt sorry for them because they looked like robots repeating protocol. The police got a call about a potential burglary in process and they sent seven vehicles, a helicopter and not one black officer but they knew it was three black people there,” she further recalled. “What did they expect would happen? We have to revise this protocol because it has resulted in many destructive ends; I am sure that one of the reasons why the police were so well behaved in this case is because of who I am.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GomWalkae5psWMpKCdq11pg3OFmGxsaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matthew-perrys-biggest-memoir-revelations-quotes-from-his-book-5181265.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Quotes From His Book Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leonidas-so-cool-20090319-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leonidas So Cool (Family Member) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
