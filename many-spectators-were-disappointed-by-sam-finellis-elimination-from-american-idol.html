However, once he got up there, he delivered an outstanding performance.&nbsp;The live crowd applauded the artist as she sang Say Something by A Great Big World. Despite his strong performance, the judges did not advance him to the next round. Many viewers were disappointed by his removal.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Sam-Finelli-3.jpg alt="Sam Finelli" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What do fans have to say about it?</h2><p>Finelli confessed before his performance that he is autistic, which makes it difficult for him to perform in front of an audience or crowd. Because he was anxious, he even broke into tears as he ended his performance. While fans expected to see more of him, he was removed from the program in the most recent episode. Many thought Finelli was cheated and should have been selected in the following round.</p><p>Here are some reactions from supporters to the elimination:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#americanidol</a> Sam got robbed</p><p>‚Äî Guess Who?
