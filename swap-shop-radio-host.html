The radio show, which has been on air since 1957, coined its title in 1970. Now that Netflix has adapted the shop's story for the screen, fans are curious about the original radio show.</p><p>Who hosts the radio show World Famous Swap Shop? Here's everything we know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is the 'World Famous Swap Shop' radio host?</h2><p>In 2021, just before the first season of Swap Shop aired on Netflix, Tennessee's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WJHL</a> wrote about the original World Famous Swap Shop radio show and spoke with Debbie Beal, the owner and general manager of WRGS Radio in Rogersville, Tenn. Debbie explained how the radio show works: "We put out the information, and then the people call each other and buy, trade, sell everything from guns to goats to chickens to cars, stereos, anything."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Debbie also explained that in 2018, she received an email from the production company Hit and Run, who were interested in turning the radio show into a television series. "And they said, ‘We had a producer going through your area [who] listened to your show, and we’ve been talking about it, we’d like to discuss it with you.’ So I contacted them and at first, I thought, ‘Well, this is like a Howard Stern prank?’ But no, it wasn’t," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tori Cooley, proprietor of West Main Antiques, said she was also called by the production company. "It was very random," she recalled. "They were like, ‘Hey, we’re doing a show in your area. Is this something that you’d be interested in looking into?’ And I was like, ‘Sure.’ And we did a couple of Skype interviews, it sounded like a really fun project, and [I'm] happy to be a part of it."</p><p>Two people who were unfortunately not called by Hollywood, however, are the voices behind the OG World Famous Swap Shop. Currently, Swap Shop, which has remained on the air as an East Tennessee staple, has two radio hosts. Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WRGS website</a>, those are Jay Phillips, who also announces Friday Football, and Tom Davis.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Whether or not the radio hosts will appear on the show is yet to be seen, but it is nice to know that after 65 years, the radio tradition is still going strong.</p><p>And for fans outside of Tennessee looking to check Swap Shop out for themselves, Seasons 1 and 2 are currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMSivIysn6ioXaeupbXOZp%2Boq6Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashlee-frazier.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>AshLee Frazier Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-merrick.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Merrick</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
