I can't thank her enough for what she has done for me.</p><span class=quote-credit>Ivan Toney</span><p>Toney is not someone who emotionally breaks down easily but any son or daughter would be moved by such a discovery about either of their parents.</p><p>And he admitted: “I don’t really cry – but hearing that touches you. The woman you love to bits, saying that.</p><p>“I reacted, ‘That’s crazy’ but when I thought about it over the next few days, I’m thinking, ‘Wowzers, she’s done that for me!</p><p>“Her sacrifice was to make sure I was eating correctly, doing good and getting to where I wanted to.</p><p>“I can’t thank her enough for what she’s done and where she’s put me today. Hopefully I can continue making her proud.</p><p>“There are things I’d love to give or do for her – but she’s not that sort of woman.</p><p>“She just tells me, ‘The way you can repay me is to score a goal and then another goal.’</p><p>“It’s only right I repay her for what she has sacrificed and put into me for all these years by getting into the Premier League.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/517435cb-63e5-4b8b-97e2-03ccd85f4ddf-1.jpg><p>Even today Lisa still likes to take good care of her son – making sure he is getting the best out of himself.</p><p>Toney said: “She messages me after games, saying, ‘Don’t let them stress you, don’t let them get into your head’ because she knows how hot-headed I can be sometimes.</p><p>“She always tells me, ‘Be the big strong striker you are and put yourself about and do the right things.’</p><p>“And even if I score or don’t score, she will be messaging me to make sure I’m good.”</p><p>Toney – bombed out by <a href=#>Rafa Benitez</a> at <a href=#>Newcastle</a> after just two top-flight sub appearances – has been the signing of the season.</p><p>Picked up for £5million from Peterborough in the summer, his strike in the 3-1 win over Bristol City last Saturday saw him break the Championship top-scorer record with 31 goals as well as win the SkyBet Golden Boot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f887595a-6236-4108-86c2-dc07a7bb8550.jpg><p>It prompted immediate congratulations from Glenn Murray, who held the record with his 30 strikes for Crystal Palace in 2012-13.</p><p>But behind the accolades and deserved acclaim, I ask the man of the moment how he would describe “the real Ivan Toney”?</p><p>“I’m confident, a winner, a joker and someone who will help anyone.”</p><p>And since I first met him following his 40-yard ‘worldy’ in the FA Cup for Peterborough against Dover in December 2019, every time we have spoken those qualities shine through.</p><p>His compassionate nature was shown by him setting up t<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he Ivan Toney St Vincent Volcano Relief Fund</a> to help those affected by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">La Soufriere eruption last month</a>, near to where his grandparents were born.</p><p>And the striker’s confidence is illustrated nicely by a funny anecdote he shares about his “second favourite goal” this season, the winner against Stoke in February – only beaten by his record-breaking one last Saturday.</p><p>He said: “Their manager Michael O’Neill was giving me stick so I told him, ‘I’m going to score and come over to celebrate right in front of you in a minute!’</p><p>“And that’s exactly what happened. He was angry and looking the other way – but he did later say, ‘Well done!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8959badb-b6ab-4bdf-848f-c98a763567dc-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SOCCER-Bristol-City-135489jpg-JS652109981.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2f912636-8ecb-425a-bbbc-2f89eb897837.jpg><p>But, as confident as he is, Toney would never attempt doing what his hero <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sergio Aguero did last week for Manchester City against Chelsea by attempting a Panenka</a> at such a key moment of the game. The Argentinian had egg on his face as he chipped it straight to Edouard Mendy.</p><p>He said: “I’ll do it at some stage during my career but we’d have to be winning 4-0 and I’d have already scored a hat-trick!</p><p>“It’s funny because me and my mate – who is a goalie – were having a debate the other day and he told me, ‘Next time you get a penalty, chip it down the middle because keepers always gamble.’</p><p>“I don’t know what Aguero was thinking of – a striker like him!</p><p>“Even if Mendy did dive because, he’s like 7ft, he’d probably still save it with his foot dangling in the air!”</p><p>Such is Toney’s lust for improvement he believes he should have scored FORTY goals after analysing every game and chance he has had – admitting: “A top striker like Harry Kane turns half chances into full chances by scoring them.”</p><p>The Brentford striker wants to be at the top of the Premier League tree like Kane.</p><p>I also don’t beat myself up after missing a chance because I know I’m going to get another one.”</p><p>And Toney uses motivational speakers he watches online and quotations for inspiration. One of his favourites, coined by American Eric Thomas, is: “When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you will be successful.”</p><p>The striker – in his pursuit for greatness – admits the biggest thing he worked on this season was his fitness.</p><p>He said: “At this club, it’s about being on the front foot, pressing and running in behind. The first four games, I was off the pace.</p><p>“There were chances that came my way that I weren’t ready for because I was tired from making the run before. I worked on that and have never felt fitter than I have this season.</p><p>“I also don’t beat myself up after missing a chance because I know I’m going to get another one.”</p><p>Toney’s body is covered by tattoos charting his life and football story – including likenesses of his young son Ivan Jnr and his late grandmother.</p><p>So what next on the Toney canvas?</p><p>He said: “My mum keeps telling me to stop getting tattoos but I’ll get a few more sneaky ones in. I’ll have to get a 31 with a golden boot next to it.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>Toney revealed he finally got round to performing his initiation song – having threatened to perform a Neil Diamond classic.</p><p>But he said: “My audience wouldn’t have appreciated Neil Diamond so I went safe with So Sick by Ne-Yo. They wanted me to perform again but I was full on my bookings so wasn’t available.”</p><p>It is ironic that Toney’s replacement at Peterborough Jonson Clarke-Harris has bettered his predecessor’s effort last season with 31 goals and led them to promotion.</p><p>While Toney himself has bettered the 25 goals Ollie Watkins scored for Brentford last season.</p><p>The Bees ace laughed: “I’m buzzing for Jonson doing better than me. Maybe I was the problem and why they didn’t get promoted!</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“If we go up, maybe Ollie can say he was the reason why Brentford didn’t get promoted!”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">IVAN TONEY Q&A</h3></p><p><strong>What was going through your mind when it looked like Sergi Canos might get to the ball ahead of what was your record-breaking goal?<br></strong><br>When the ball broke, it was about composure. Make sure the keeper doesn’t get there first and Sergi doesn’t get there second!</p><p>In my head it was, 'tackle Sergi if he takes it off me and we will go from there.' But he left it for me</p><p>You could see what it meant to all the boys because they all came over and celebrated. It meant a lot.</p><p><strong>What has it been like playing for Thomas Frank?<br></strong><br>He has kept me focused. He’s always saying to me, “Be confident, be humble” and I feel like I have been like that throughout the season.</p><p>I know if a chance comes my way, I am going to take it.</p><p>When I cross the white line, I think, “I am going to score today.”</p><p>That is the confident part and being humble is not telling anyone or bragging about it. You are thinking it but keeping it to yourself.</p><p>On a personal note, he is like a friend. He’s always genuinely asking how people are, how their families are? He does genuinely care and it’s good to have a manager like that.</p><p><strong>Do you have any superstitions?<br></strong><br>As a Christian, I always pray before the game. My nan has a little prayer that she always said to me before matches – so I do it every game now.</p><p>I also always put my right boot on first before my left. I don’t know why. I just feel like it’s a must – maybe because I am right footed.</p><p><strong>Do you study Premier League strikers while watching games?<br></strong><br>I watch clips from some strikers. When I am watching a game, I watch a striker’s movement.</p><p>It might be a bit boring for everyone else but it helps my game and I am trying to be a better player all round. These little things help out.</p><p><strong>Who is the Premier League striker you most admire?<br></strong><br>It was Sergio Aguero with just the way he is in front of goal. He’s just so clinical – one opportunity, you know 9 times out of 10, it's in the back of the net.</p><p>But more recently, it has to be Harry Kane – you see how deadly he is in front of goal.</p><p>There was a game I saw where he had two chances and he put them into the back of the net.</p><p>He makes half chances full chances. That is what good strikers do.</p><p>And Harry’s link-up play – along with his goals and assists – is incredible.</p><p>He is someone anyone can look up to – not just myself but any striker. If you take some of his game into yours, you are going to be a good striker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH51hZRvaWlwX6m8r7HYZpmrnZ6ps7C%2Bw2akrqVdnLyiuNJmqq2qmaCys3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dana-perino-fox-news-salary-net-worth-education-annual-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dana Perino Among Richest Fox News Women With Massive Salary &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-steve-stevens-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Steve Stevens Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
