She became the second person to die while filming the show, and the sixth <a href=#>My 600-Lb Life</a> star to lose the battle against obesity and its related complications.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mercedes Cephus from 'My 600-lb Life' struggled with lymphedema.</h2><p>On My 600-lb Life, viewers learned that Mercedes struggles with severe lymphedema. This means her lymph glands don't work properly, and Mercedes accumulates fluids in her extremities — which is terrible for the heart, liver and other organs.</p><p>Mercedes could barely stand on the show, and she spent most of her day bed-bound, which is <a href=#>quite common for patients</a> who appear on the show. However, it was not just her own life she was putting in peril with her poor health and disordered eating habits. Mercedes also had two small children, who she was unable to care for.</p><p>What's more, the roles in Mercedes' family are completely reversed, and the burden falls on her two little kids to take care of her. Mercedes also gets help from her extended family in caring for herself and for her children, since her weight became too much to deal with on her own.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How is Mercedes Cephus from 'My 600-lb Life' doing now?</h2><p>Unfortunately for those wondering how Mercedes is doing now, she hasn't been publicly active on social media since appearing on My 600-lb Life. There are only a handful of photos she's posted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook,</a> and her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> account is empty.</p><p>Mercedes' lack of updates may have something to do with her time on My 600-lb Life, during which she failed to make significant improvements in her weight loss journey.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout the course of the show, she was only able to lose around 80 pounds and had a myriad of reasons to give <a href=#>Dr. Now</a> each weigh-in for why she hadn't dropped more. Ultimately, she wasn't able to get the weight-loss surgery because she didn't lose enough weight and after returning from Houston, she began a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the procedure.</p><p>"My name is Mercedes Cepha.s I am 37-year-old single mother of two, and I have been struggling with weight issues for most of my life and started to gain more weight during and after the births of both my children," the GoFun<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">d</a>Me began.
