However, Ubah is beginning to let audiences in, discussing more about her mother to the women on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New York</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Business consultant Kathleen Kelley bringing up Ubah's mother is crucial during their conversation on the fourth episode of RHONY Season 14. The chat is about Ubah Hot and Ubah's growing desire to expand the business that has been successful since its launch in June 2021. Her vulnerable side is heartbreaking, but it's also great to see just how much love Ubah truly has for her mother.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the challenges Ubah has faced over the years have also included her father — and three siblings. She's expressed love for her mother on several occasions, but little has been said about several other family members, including her father.</p><p>So, what does this all mean? Is Ubah close with her parents and other relatives? Let's find out!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ubah has only mentioned one of her parents so far on 'RHONY'.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Ubah's childhood is extraordinarily heartbreaking for multiple reasons, one of which being that she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">separated</a> from her mother and two sisters at a young age. Indeed, Ubah's mother and sisters fled Somalia for Ethiopia, while Ubah, her brother, and her father fled to Kenya.</p><p>Reuniting in Canada years later, it wasn't long after that until Ubah was discovered by a photographer.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Ubah has had little to say about her father and siblings compared to her mother, who passed away in December 2012 after receiving a late-stage leukemia diagnoses.</p><p>"My mom got diagnosed on a Saturday and the doctor told us she had 48 hours [to live]. We didn't believe it, but she passed away the following Tuesday" Ubah told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OK!</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kathleen and Ubah's heart-to-heart is quite powerful to see as audiences can finally understand just how much of a difference Ubah's mother makes in her life regarding her career.</p><p>Ubah calls her mother "the boss" and the "bread winner" of her family, who taught her "everything was possible."</p><p>The relationship between Ubah and her father is unclear to the public, but she has seemingly never said an ill word about him to the media or to anyone on RHONY.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">While she may be private about her parents, Ubah Hassan has been more open about her famous cousin.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>One fun fact to know about Ubah is that she's had a connection to The Real Housewives franchise since June 2022, when <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Dubai</a> premiered. Show star <a href=#>Chanel Ayan</a> is not only a supporter for Ubah, but she is also Ubah's cousin, who even gave her advice prior to the Season 14 premiere of RHONY.</p><p>“Chanel just said to have entertainment, drama," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> in October 2022. "But nothing ill-intended because we are all human and we are all women. Make it fun but don’t go below the belt,” she added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Ubah has also hinted at a relative of hers without naming any names, including a niece who she appears to be very close to. Not only did Ubah take her to the US Open in 2017, but she also posted a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> on her Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ubah,</a> featuring the pair.</p><p>Although she didn't specify who her niece's parents are, it may be safe to say that while it's unknown how close Ubah is with her father, she has maintained a good relationship with at least one of her three siblings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqq%2BitIyhmKyrkaN6sa3RnqWtq12ntbC62A%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-kelce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Kelce</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./talanoa-hufanga-2fp9-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Talanoa Hufanga (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
