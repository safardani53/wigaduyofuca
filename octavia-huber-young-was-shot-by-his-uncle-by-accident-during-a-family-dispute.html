His parents evicted him from the home in the middle of a violent argument with his sibling over a t-shirt. At 4:20 p.m., he is accused of hurting two guys at his Wells home.&nbsp;According to Maine State Police Detective Connor Walten, Andrew Huber Young, 19, returned to the home and started shooting wildly, wounded Ethan Huber Young, his brother, and father, Mark Evans Young, eventually murdering two-year-old newborn Octavia Huber Young, who was in her father’s arms. He reportedly grabbed his father’s.22 caliber revolver and used it to shoot at his family members.</p><p>Andrew’s father was shot in the face, while his brother was injured in the left shoulder. According to authorities, they did not sustain any serious injuries. The bullet passed through Octaviav Huber Young’s left arm and into her chest. Octavia was transported to the hospital, where she was autopsied. The small child did not survive the injuries and died shortly after.</p><p>Detectives corroborated the report by stating,</p><p>“Huber Young admitted to being the one who fired the gun.” He said that he intended to fire at Ethan’s chest but did not want to kill him. He stated he desired Ethan’s respect and had major anger management issues.”</p><p>Andrew’s court-appointed attorney, David Bobrow, has declined to comment on the event but has made a short statement calling the gunshot inadvertent. He explained,</p><p>“This terrible incident has severely upset the lad.” There are no words to express his feelings.”</p><h2>What caused Octavia Huber Young’s death?</h2><p><strong>The brothers started bickering early in the morning when Andrew saw Ethan wearing one of his Carhart T-shirts</strong>. According to Andrew, the fight heated up when Ethan changed into a second T-shirt belonging to his brother.&nbsp;Candace Huber, Ethan’s wife, seized Andrew’s cellphone, and the two of them, together with Octavia Huber Young, left the house shortly. When they returned, they discovered Andrew in Ethan’s bedroom, destroying his stuff. In exchange, Ethan demolished Andrew’s hamster cage. The dispute became more heated, and their father told Huber-Young to leave, which he did.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Octavia-Huber-Young-3.jpg alt="Octavia Huber Young" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to reports, he headed straight to meet up with his lover. She informed the cops that Andrew was silent and appeared to enjoy himself throughout the automobile journey. They attended a baseball game where Huber-Young and his brother were reportedly still arguing over text messages.</p><p>When they returned to Wells, the girlfriend reported that she had seen Andrew open his vehicle trunk and “mess about” with a gray bag, but she had never seen him with a weapon. Andrew Huber Young subsequently confessed to investigators that he grabbed the loaded weapon and placed it in his trunk.</p><h2>Who was Octavia Huber Young?</h2><p>Octavia Huber Young was a two-year-old child who was reportedly murdered by her uncle after a heated fight about a t-shirt. Samantha Higgins, Octavia’s mother, and the rest of the family are saddened by the death of their child.</p><p>To WGME, she characterized her daughter Octavia Huber Young as,</p><p>“She was full of life and always liked to grin and play.” She aspired to be like her older sister. When she needed my attention, she would always grasp my finger and drag me into her room to play with her. She loved going outdoors to play on her swing set.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Octavia-Huber-Young-4.jpg alt="Octavia Huber Young" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A GoFundMe effort has been launched to assist Octavia’s mother, Higgins, with financial assistance. According to the page,</p><p>“Experiencing such a loss would be a highly traumatic experience, and we would want to see her get financial assistance so that she may be with family during this time.”</p><p>Andrew Huber Young is being jailed without bail at the York County Jail for the murder of Octavia Huber Young. According to authorities, he is facing more charges. It was unclear whether he had entered a plea or hired legal representation.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGimnKyRq7aieceumZ6qXa68trrGZq6aq12otbDAjJuwZqCZqHq2usKlnGaaqWKupK%2FInZynrF2ZwrO1zaBkmmWWlrqquNhmm6KroKrBpns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-in-thong-bikinis-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Photos of Farrah Abraham and More Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-siblings-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>About Kelsea Ballerinis Parents, Siblings, And Early Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
