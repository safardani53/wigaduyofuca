The rest, they say, is history, as the veteran Scottish-born actor on to play Harry Potter’s pal in all 8 movies in the iconic franchise. Sadly, Robbie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passed away</a> on October 14, 2022, as confirmed by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood Reporter, </a>after a long battle with an undisclosed illness.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Fans around the world will remember him best in the iconic role, and that was something Robbie admitted he was most proud of in the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harry Potter 20th anniversary</a> special. “The legacy of these movies is that my children’s generation will show them to their children,” he said with tears in his eyes. “So, you could be watching them in 50 years time, easy. I’ll not be here, sadly… But Hagrid will.” In the special, it was clear just how close he had gotten to the cast of the films. He shared a special moment particularly with<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Emma Watson</strong></a>, who played Hermione, as they reflected on her growing up on-screen. She also lamented that the beloved actor was poised to cause more ‘”mischief” than any of the child actors, with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rupert Grint</strong> </a>chiming in that he was <span class=s1>“such a kid.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After the news of his passing, many of Robbie’s Potter co-stars were quick to pay tribute to their friend who they loved so dearly, just as many had done when other <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Potter icons have passed away recently</a>.</p><h2>Daniel Radcliffe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Robbie-Coltrane-harry-potter-celebs-mourn-everett-embed-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the Harry Potter story, Hagrid is the first person to tell the young boy from Privet Drive that he’s a wizard. Perhaps then is makes sense that one of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first stars to honor</a> Robbie was the man behind the Boy Who Lived, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Daniel Radcliffe.</strong></a>&nbsp;“Robbie was one of the funniest people I’ve met and used to keep us laughing constantly as kids on the set,” his statement reads, via <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “I’ve especially fond memories of him keeping our spirits up on ‘Prisoner of Azkaban,’ when we were all hiding from the torrential rain for hours in Hagrid’s hut and he was telling stories and cracking jokes to keep morale up. I feel incredibly lucky that I got to meet and work with him and very sad that he’s passed.

His talent was so immense it made sense he played a giant he could fill any space with his brilliance. Robbie, if I ever get to be so kind as you were to me on a film set I promise I’ll do it in your name and memory. Know how much I adore and admire you. I’ll really miss your sweetness your nicknames your warmth your laughs and your hugs. You made us a family. No you were that to us. There was no better Hagrid.

Robbie cared & looked after everyone around of him. Effortlessly. And made them laugh. Effortlessly. He was a big friendly giant on screen but even more so In real life.

It would take until her character enrolled in Hogwarts in The Chamber Of Secrets for Bonnie to get the chance to work with Robbie, but the experience left an unmistakeable mark on her life. In her tribute to him on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram,</a> the star shared her grief but also her thanks to the kind man who would look after the young stars in the movies.&nbsp; “Heartbroken by the passing of Robbie Coltrane,” she wrote. “Hagrid was my favourite character! Robbie portrayed Hagrid’s warmth, sense of home and unconditional love for his students and magical creatures so brilliantly. Robbie always treated me and my fellow cast mates when we were wee kids like equal professionals on a film set. A type of attitude that instilled confidence and a sense of togetherness. Thanks for all the laughter. Miss you Robbie. Sending love to your family.
