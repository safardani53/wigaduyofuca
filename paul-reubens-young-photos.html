The actor’s death following a private battle with cancer was announced on Monday, July 31. He was 70 years old. Following his death, he posthumously released a statement. ‘Please accept my apology for not going public with what I’ve been facing the last six years. I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect for my friends, fans, and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you,’ he said.</p><p>Born in Peekskill, New York, Paul began working in television after completing school at the California Institute for the Arts. After a few appearances on programs like ‘The Gong Show,’ Paul joined the improv troupe The Groundlings, where he began to develop the character that would become Pee-wee Herman.</p><p>After a failed ‘Saturday Night Live’ audition, Paul began ‘The Pee-wee Herman Show’ as a live stage show. He became a mainstream star when HBO showed the performance in 1981. He began making many public appearances as Pee-wee, including in films like ‘Cheech And Chong’s Next Movie’ in 1981. The character proved so popular that it led to the movie ‘Pee-wee’s Big Adventure’ and TV show ‘Pee-wee’s Playhouse,’ which ran from 1986 until 1991.</p><p>Following a 1991 arrest, Paul avoided the public eye, but slowly began making appearances in other non-Pee-wee-related projects like ‘Murphy Brown’, ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’, ’30 Rock’, and ‘Blow.’</p><p>In 2010, Paul starred in a new version of ‘The Pee-wee Herman Show,’ which ran on Broadway and was taped for HBO. In 2016, ‘Pee-Wee’s Big Holiday’ was released on Netflix. He continued to take on small acting and voice-acting roles in recent years.</p><p>Following the sad news of his death, scroll through our gallery to see photos of Paul over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZL2iwctmqZ6tkpq7tHnYqKynn12ltbDAzqxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-amber-leduc-kyle-leduc-wife-age-and-wikipedia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Amber Leduc?
