Throughout her time in the spotlight, <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a> has never been afraid to call out the influence of sexism and misogyny on her career.</p><p>In 2009, the <a href=#>Transformers</a> actress, 34, raised eyebrows with fiery comments about her experience working with director <a href=#><strong>Michael Bay</strong></a> on the first two installments of the action films. “‘Be hot.’ I’ve had that note on set before,” she told <a href=#>Wonderland</a> magazine at the time. “I’ll say, ‘Who am I talking to? Where am I supposed to be looking at?’ And he responds, ‘Just be sexy.’ I get mad when people talk to me like that.”</p><p>More than a decade later, footage of Fox detailing a particularly uncomfortable audition for Bay resurfaced on social media. During a <a href=#>2009 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>, the actress remembered being asked to put on a bikini and high heels to dance under a waterfall in 2003’s Bad Boys II. “At 15, I was in 10th grade,” she said at the time. “That’s sort of a microcosm of how Bay’s mind works.”</p><p>Shortly after the old interview went viral, Fox <a href=#>took to Instagram to address the conversations</a> that had “erupted online” about her “experiences in Hollywood and the subsequent mishandling of this information” at the time. The New Girl actress was <a href=#>fired from Bay’s films</a> after taking aim at his directing style.</p><p>“While I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support, I do feel I need to clarify some of the details as they have been lost in the retelling of the events and cast a sinister shadow that doesn’t really, in my opinion, belong,” she wrote in a lengthy Instagram statement on Monday, June 22, before going into detail about her time working with Bay and her previous claims. “When it comes to my direct experiences with Michael, and <a href=#><strong>Steven [Spielberg]</strong></a> for that matter, I was never assaulted or preyed upon in what I felt was a sexual manner.”</p><p>Two years earlier, Fox opened up about why she decided to stay silent as some of the most powerful men in Hollywood finally <a href=#>faced consequences for their inappropriate histories</a> amid the #MeToo movement.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One could assume that I probably have quite a few stories, and I do — I didn’t speak out for many reasons,” she explained to the <a href=#>New York Times</a>. “I just didn’t think based on how I’d been received by people, and by feminists, that I would be a sympathetic victim.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive more of Fox’s most critical comments about the way Hollywood treats its female stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqazwKdkn6eoqHquu9KtZKmnp5q%2Fp8HLZqiup6SawG6twaisrWWSmravs4yaZLCnnZa7brXNZp%2BopJyuxLC7w2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-les-dudek-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Les Dudek Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malcolm-jamal-warner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Malcolm-Jamal Warner Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
