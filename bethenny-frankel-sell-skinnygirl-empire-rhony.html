"I want to get off this. I need a break."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm realizing, I'm taking on too much and I'm burnt. We need to let some air out of the tires," she added. "I need some support and help. It's all been too much. I can't breathe."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Frankel — mom to daughter Bryn, 8 — founded Skinnygirl back in 2009, with the creation of her famed pre-packaged Skinnygirl Margarita. Its success led her to sell Skinnygirl Cocktails to Fortune Brands' Beam Global (now a part of Suntory) back in 2011, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>for an estimated $100 million</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She maintained control oer the name, spinning Skinnygirl into a sea of successful products including candy, deli meat, sweeteners, popcorn, salad dressings, shapewear, and most recently, jeans and apparel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All of the seeds that I planted years ago didn't factor in for divorce and custody battle, a relief effort that I put on, a death, etc," Frankel said. "It's every day, all day. I'm with Bryn for every activity, and then it's boom — on a plane to North Carolina. Then boom, on a plane to Florida for relief. … I'm not going on like this."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With "multiple offers" on the table to buy Skinnygirl, Frankel finally realized that she was ready to make the sale happen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm open now to moving some pieces around on the board so I can let go of the current stress of taking on too much because I'm going to solve this problem. This will get resolved," she said. "I'm not looking to exit, I'm just looking for ways to take some pressure off."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cindy Ord/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later in the episode, Frankel met with Bernt Ullmann, the president of her company BB Endeavors, to discuss the potential sale.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the meeting, they discussed leveraging offers from unnamed buyers, explaining they had a previous offer on the table to sell that they're glad they didn't take.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One thing that I've really done in my business is I've made the right moves," Frankel told audiences. "As great as that is, you get a little protective. So this would be, I'm sitting at the chess board and I just don't know what pieces to move around. But I'm telling you, I'm moving pieces around."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It feels really nice that people are very impressed with the Skinnygirl brand, with what I've built," Frankel added. "I still feel like I'm the young girl struggling to make it work. This is more than a decade later and it's a known brand name. I just have to decide what the dynamic is going to be."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Coppola/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, Frankel said she was happy to step back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want to do this. I want to take some pressure off. I can't live like this," she said. "I want my life to be different. I don't want to be rushing out of something to get to something else to get to be with my daughter. I have a good relationship going with a great guy and I want to keep it that way. I want it to be balanced."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A source tells PEOPLE that Frankel has not made the sale yet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Bethenny has been approached with numerous lucrative offers as a result of the success of the brand," a source who knows Frankel tells PEOPLE. "She owns 100 percent of the Skinny Girl intellectual property, outside of cocktails. She is still reviewing offers, but they have to align with her vision for the future of the brand before entertaining making any moves."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Real Housewives of New York City</a> airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKOx06Gcp6apYrOzrc2knKVlo5q5rXnSpKCnpqmctrO4jJ6kqaGimnqztM6nsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities-in-sparkly-dresses-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities In Sparkly Dresses Photos Of Stars In The Style Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-whitney-dillon-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Whitney Dillon Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
