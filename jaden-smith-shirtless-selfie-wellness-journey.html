The “Ninety” rapper posted a shirtless selfie along with several other snaps on Monday, Feb. 28 to celebrate going on tour with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Justin Bieber.</a>&nbsp;</strong>He flexed for a shirtless mirror selfie as his Calvin Klein boxers peaked over his low-rise jeans. The actor put his abs on display as he wore a wild number of necklaces.</p><p><span class="_7UhW9 xLCgt MMzan KV-D4 se6yk T0kll">The other pics seemed to chronologize his process of getting ready to hit the road. “On The Road Again,” he captioned the pic referencing Justin Bieber’s “Justice” tour. He received plenty of love for his shirtless selfie. The “Ghost” singer even left a comment on the post jokingly calling Jaden “dad.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>He’s also celebrating gaining weight after his parents&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Will Smith</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jada Pinkett Smith</a>&nbsp;</strong>expressed concerns about him being too skinny. Fortunately, he has made great strides since then and revealed on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Red Table Talk</a>&nbsp;in December 2021 that he has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gained 10lbs.</a> “I was able to work with the doctors and really get my vitamins and get my supplements and protein shakes,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>singer/actor</a>&nbsp;explained. “That’s half of my diet. It’s like a password that I have to find to my body. I’m like, ten pounds heavier now, at this point. I feel like I’m keeping on my weight. I’m able to put on more muscle.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jaden-Smith-Shirtless-Gain-Weight-MEGA-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jada had explained on the same show two years ago that she and Will were concerned because their son was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>too skinny</a> to the point where he had “dark circles” under his eyes. “Will and I had a bit of an intervention with Jaden because he’s a vegan now, but we realized he wasn’t getting enough protein,” Jada explained on the show in September 2019. “So he was wasting away. He just looked drained, he was just depleted, he wasn’t getting the nutrients.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Fortunately, Jaden is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>feeling better</a> and ready to kick off Justin Bieber’s “Justice” tour as an opening act. His parents are surely proud of his progress as well as his sister&nbsp;<strong>Willow Smith.&nbsp;</strong>He also has the support of his new love interest&nbsp;<strong>Sab Zada.&nbsp;</strong>The two were spotted showing some <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PDA</a> in Disneyland as they celebrated Valentine’s Day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49qZqOZlJq7br%2FMoquhZaOdtrPAy56qrGWjmrmntcRmrp6knKOytL%2BMo6auqp6axnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-boyfriend-jealous-meek-mill-flirts-hassan-jameel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rihannas Boyfriend Jealous After Meek Mill Flirts With Singer Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-get-through-these-13-criminal-minds-moments-without-crying.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Can You Get Through These 12 Criminal Minds Moments Without Crying?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
