While the pair called it quits before <a href=#>the show’s fourth and final season</a> aired, the Hart of Dixie alum credits her romance with the Jennifer’s Body star with helping her adjust to life in the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/How-Rachel-Bilson-Ex-Adam-Brody-Supported-Her-Through-OC-Stardom-Promo.jpg><p>“Because of what the show was and how young we all were, going through it with someone experiencing the same thing and having that kind of support was really awesome,” Bilson recalled during a recent interview with <a href=#>Nylon</a> magazine. “I’m actually grateful that I did have it. It was definitely a unique experience and I don’t think anyone else could have really understood it had they not been in it.”</p><p>The Take Two alum said that dating someone who knew exactly what she was going through at that time “was super helpful and supportive,” adding, “I have total gratitude for the whole experience.”</p><p>Brody went on to marry <a href=#><strong>Leighton Meester</strong> </a>in 2014. The pair share daughter Arlo, 5, and a 7-month-old son whose name they haven’t publicly shared. Bilson, for her part, shares daughter Briar, 6, with ex <a href=#><strong>Hayden Christensen</strong></a>.</p><p>Seth and Summer’s romance wasn’t always perfect, but even amid their ups and downs, the duo always found their way back to one another. As for where the iconic TV couple would be today, Bilson has a few ideas.</p><p>“I would say they have little Seth and Summers, I would think. … I’m sure they’re still together and have a family,” the Jumper actress told the outlet.</p><p>Bilson is <a href=#>looking back on her favorite moments</a> from the series with costar <a href=#><strong>Melinda Clarke</strong></a>, who played Julie Cooper, for their upcoming “Welcome to the OC, Bitches!” podcast. Reliving their days in Orange County has been “awesome,” but when it comes to an official reboot, Bilson isn’t sure they could make it work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/How-Rachel-Bilson-Ex-Adam-Brody-Supported-Her-Through-OC-Stardom-Inline.jpg><p>“You know, I’ve always said anything that Josh [Schwartz, creator] and Stephanie [Savage, executive producer] want to do, I’m on board for,” the How I Met Your Mother alum admitted. “But it’s kind of hard to figure out what you’d do with the characters and where they would be. I will say if they ever wanted to do it, I would do it. But I just don’t know where you go [with the plot].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though she’s reconnecting with Clarke, 51, Bilson hasn’t kept super close tabs on many other former O.C. stars. After congratulating <a href=#><strong>Ben McKenzie</strong> </a>on <a href=#>his and <strong>Morena Baccarin</strong>‘s newborn son</a> in March, the actress was inspired to plan a reunion with The O.C.‘s next generation.</p><p>“We’ve all talked about getting together, so we’re hoping that happens sometime soon,” Bilson said. “We just want to get together, get all the kids together. It’s just so crazy. Everyone has kids, or a lot of us do, anyway. It’d be a trip for sure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmam5iauW6uyKWqqKZdnrpus9Gaq56epaF6qnnDmquenF2WsaK5jJupqJypYrG2vsinnmanXZh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./role-models-hjdc-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Role Models (2008 film) - Members profile, Facts, Wiki, Achievements, Net worth 2024 (updated)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joel-meyerowitz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joel Meyerowitz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
