The forthcoming episode, which marks the second season of the program, will follow the same pattern as previous installments. Famous people’s relatives will cohabitate in order to uncover one other’s true identities and keep theirs hidden.</p><p>The forthcoming season, according to ABC, has a lot in store:</p><p>“They will compete in tasks, develop strategic collaborations, and play DNA detective in the hopes of avoiding elimination, earning the coveted $100,000 prize, and stepping out of their famous family member’s shadow by staking their own “Claim to Fame.” Season two will be twice as entertaining, with double the competition, drama, and more!”</p><p>The season debut of Claim to Fame season 2 will air on Monday, June 26 at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p></p><h2>“It got crazy”: Claim to Fame hosts Kevin and Franklin Jonas discuss Season 2</h2><p>Season 2 of Claim to Fame will introduce a fresh group of famous relatives who have spent their lives away from the limelight. Throughout the program, they will compete in various tasks to keep their identities and the identities of their famous relatives hidden. Along with this, they must scheme, lie to, and mislead one another in order to be the last ones remaining.</p><p>Each week, players will participate in a series of tasks to decide who will be protected from identification and who will be removed. Those who are at the bottom will inevitably be in danger. Meanwhile, the remaining participants will pick who will be the guesser of the week. As a guesser, the competitor will choose another person and attempt to guess their famous relative. The main reward is $100,000, and the winner will get it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Claim-to-Fame-1.jpg alt="Claim to Fame" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If their prediction is right, the individual whose identity they expose will be removed. If they are incorrect, their true identity will be discovered, and they will be returned home.&nbsp;Before the season 2 launch, hosts Kevin and Franklin spoke about the program with Entertainment Tonight, giving some hints about what to expect. They said that one of the characters in the program is linked to an “Oscar winner” who “loves volleyballs” and was the captain at one time in his life.”This celebrity was one of the first to announce that they had Covid.”</p><p>Kevin eventually revealed the celebrity’s name, stating that it was Tom Hanks:</p><p>“It’s ridiculous. When it occurs, you’ll be amazed at how chaotic it becomes. It is without a doubt one of the finest revelations of the whole season.”</p><p>Kevin also claimed that shooting Claim to Fame season 2 was a lot of fun and that the forthcoming season would be “bigger and better than ever.”&nbsp;He said that the contenders are ecstatic to be there and have developed a strategy. Franklin went on to say:</p><p>“It got out of hand. Everyone knew precisely what they were bringing with them, and you know, the greater your scheme, the bigger your falsehoods, the harder you fall – and we’ve got some insane drama this season.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Claim-to-Fame-2.jpg alt="Claim to Fame" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Franklin went on to say that being a host was a new experience for him and that he trusted Kevin to teach and coach him through it. However, in Claim to Fame season 2, he said that the two were able to “let loose” more and enjoy the “wild things.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>ABC</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Claim to Fame Season 2</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiapZmZonq1u4yfmKadXaiyor%2FOp2RrZZmoerSx02arqGWgp7KutcSrnGannmKuo6%2BMrKaopl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dick-carlson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Dick Carlson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-wwe-alberto-del-rio-violence.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WWE star Paige claims ex Alberto Del Rio physically abused her daily for hours but ex-champ says she</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
