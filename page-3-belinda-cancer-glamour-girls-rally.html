Speaking at the Vanity Fair-style shoot with eight of her Page 3 ­colleagues for The Sun, brave Belinda said: “I cannot thank these ­wonderful women enough.</p><p>“To be here today, feeling this fabulous with everyone’s support behind me feels like a dream.” Belinda, 49, modelled for Page 3 in the mid-Nineties under her maiden name Belinda Charlton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000386150269.jpg><p>In 2008, ten years after her modelling heyday, she first felt an agonising pain in her face.</p><p>She explained: “The only way I can describe it is like someone poking a knitting needle down my ear. It travels along the nerves like a live wire.”</p><p>Belinda, of Rochester, Kent, had to endure five years of agony before she was diagnosed in 2013 with rare ­cancer adenoid cystic carcinoma.</p><p>She recalled: “I was told I probably had 18 months left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000383111292.jpg><p>“It was like the air had been punched out of me. All I could think was, ‘How am I supposed to tell my kids this?’”</p><p>The consultant told Belinda that chemotherapy would prob- ably not help, and that surgery would “mutilate” her. She tried chemo anyway but that treatment did not work so Belinda went in for surgery in 2014 at London’s Royal Marsden Hospital.</p><p>She added: “It was a 15-hour operation. They opened up my face and drilled through my teeth and jaw to get to the cancer.</p><p>“I was left with a scar running down my chin and neck and back up to my ear. Doctors told me I wouldn’t be able to talk or able to eat, but I beat the odds on all of them. I eat, I drink.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000383111290.jpg><p>Belinda was settling back into normal life when a year later, in December 2015, the cancer returned. This time the prognosis was even worse.</p><p>She said: “This time it was on my lungs. They just had to ­monitor its growth — there was no treatment available.</p><p>“Four months ago I had my ­latest scan, they found cancer in two places in my spine, in my sternum and back in my face. The doctors say there’s nothing they can do for me any more.</p><p>“It’s a horrible feeling — like everyone has given up on you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000383111294.jpg><p>But husband Carl, 48, did not give up, and found out about the Hyperthermie Bochum clinic near Dortmund, which has had success in curing her rare form of cancer.</p><p>Bodyguard Carl explained: “We have to send them a blood ­sample, then they will hopefully offer Belinda a bespoke treatment. We’re optimistic.”</p><p>The couple hope to send the blood off this month. But if the tests reveal treatment will not work, Belinda will seek holistic treatment in Mexico to extend her life. Belinda’s daughters Nadia, 19, and Georgia, 26, have known her prognosis for a while, but it is only in the past couple of weeks that she’s told her ­youngest Ollie, 12, the full truth.</p><p>She says: “He’s a really sensitive boy and it’s hit him hard. But he’s been so good. He keeps offering to do everything for me. Even at his age he’s so thoughtful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000383111296.jpg><p>The treatment and aftercare will cost £250,000, which Belinda cannot afford — and this is where her Page 3 pals stepped in.</p><p>As well as this shoot the group is doing fun runs and bake sales and have so far raised £14,000.</p><p>Belinda said: “I have such fond memories of my Page 3 days and we were like a family — a lot of us stayed in touch.</p><p>“Tracey Elvik and Tracy Kirby were the driving forces behind setting up my GoFundMe page, I can’t thank them enough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000383111298.jpg><p>Loyal Tracey, 49, had tears in her eyes when Belinda entered the studio on Saturday in a red satin gown, and whispered: “She looks so beautiful.”</p><p>She revealed: “After the cancer spread we looked into alternative treatments and Belinda got quite upset because of the costs.</p><p>“I suggested setting up a fundraising site but she said she couldn’t ask people for money. I told her, ‘Yes you bloody can.’”</p><p>Meanwhile Belinda found the shoot a trip down memory lane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000386117035.jpg><p>She said: “Those days were a total whirlwind. We had so much fun — the travelling, the camaraderie. The whole thing was a blast — a really wonderful time.<br>“It’s so lovely to relive it today - this is something I’ll remember forever. Even though the circumstances aren’t the best I feel like the luckiest girl in the world.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Dresses from left-to-right in main image</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000386117035.jpg><ul><li><strong>Jenny</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £169, Monsoon</a></li><li><strong>Lisa</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £75, Asos</a></li><li><strong>Debee</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £169, Monsoon</a></li><li><strong>Anna Marie</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £295, Phase Eight</a></li><li><strong>Tracy K</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £32, Miss Selfridge</a></li><li><strong>Belinda</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £195, Coast</a></li><li><strong>Tracey E</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £49, M&S</a></li><li><strong>Donna</strong> - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dress, £140, Phase Eight</a></li><li><strong>Dee</strong> - <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dress, £129, Coast</a></li></ul><h2>Page 3 girls rallying round Belinda</h2><h2>Jenny Blyth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000001030321.jpg><p>Jenny Blyth modelled in Eighties and now works as a mobile hairdresser and beautician in London.</p><p>The 56-year-old single mum of one said: “We were all really privileged to have worked on Page 3 during those iconic years.”<br></p><h2>Lisa Bangert</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000386150237-e1518984702740.jpg><p>“Bangers” was one of the most famous Page 3 girls from 1992 to 2002.</p><p>Single Lisa, 46, now lives in Mansfield, Notts, and is a carer for people with Alzheimer’s. &nbsp;She said: “I adore my job – the ­people are amazing.”<br></p><h2>Debee Ashby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000386154841-e1518984748609.jpg><p>Debee Page was on Page 3 from 1983 to late 90s and now runs a property firm on the Isle of Man.</p><p>The engaged mum of one, 50, said: “It’s strange to glam up again – I’m more used to wearing my trackies up on scaffolding.”<br></p><h2>Anna Maria Kalebic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000386155060-e1518984810959.jpg><p>After finishing her Page 3 career in the late 90s she became a flight attendant.</p><p>Now 46, married and with three daughters, she works promoting a plant-based diet.
