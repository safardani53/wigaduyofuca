The Musical in April 2021, <a href=# style=text-align:start>Zac Efron</a> sparked rumors of plastic surgery. As viewers zoomed in on his face, they noticed Zac’s jaw and lips looking <a href=#>especially plump</a>, causing mass speculation on social media.</p><p>While some defended Zac's right to bodily autonomy, others criticized him for the supposed choice. Thankfully, Zac cleared the air in an interview, revealing exactly what happened to his jaw. Did he get plastic surgery? Here's the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Zac Efron get plastic surgery?</h2><p>Initially, some fans believed Zac had injections, meaning any adjustments to his jaw and cheeks would not be permanent. According to <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">plastic surgeon</a> Dr. Anthony Youn, who spoke with OK! in April 2021, “Zac does look quite different, with a wider jaw especially on the right. I suppose it’s possible he’s had injections of filler to reshape his jaw.”</p><p>Another plastic surgeon, Dr. Chris Funderburk, told the outlet at the time that Zac may have “fallen victim to the overfilled face with facial fillers. This happens frequently when patients find a cosmetic injector (frequently of the celebrity variety) who they trust, but the injector either 1) has a poor grasp on proper facial aesthetics or 2) is just milking a wealthy client for more money with continued injections.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zac Efron (@zacefron)</a></p></figure><p>Thankfully, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men's Health</a> for its October 2022 issue, Zac finally set the rumors straight about his changing appearance. The actor has become very vocal about facing body image issues, especially following his intense training to get his 2017 Baywatch physique. Zac explained that training so hard for such a long amount of time was making him physically ill to maintain.</p><p>"I started to develop insomnia and I fell into a pretty bad depression, for a long time. Something about that experience burned me out. I had a really hard time recentering. Ultimately they chalked it up to taking way too many diuretics for way too long, and it messed something up," Zac says.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jimmy Kimmel Live (@jimmykimmellive)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@jimmykimmellive</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happened to Zac Efron's jaw? An accident is responsible for it's changed appearance.</h2><p>The Iron Claw actor ultimately revealed that, four years ago, he suffered a terrifying accident to his jaw, although it was not related to his intense workout regimen. Interviewer Lauren Larson writes, "He’d been running through his house in socks and slipped, smacking his chin against the granite corner of a fountain. He lost consciousness, and when he woke up, he recalls, his chin bone was hanging off his face."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zac Efron (@zacefron)</a></p></figure><p>The interviewer said Zac told her that "the masseter muscles, used for chewing, work together with the other muscles of the face 'like a symphony'; when he was injured, the muscles on the inside of his face and jaw had to compensate."</p><p>Zac revealed that he'd regularly seen a specialist and had done physical therapy to help with this issue, but he had taken time off from doing so while in Australia, where he'd relocated during the pandemic. "The masseters just grew ... they just got really, really big,” he said.</p><p>Fans are just happy that Zac is OK after what sounds like a terrifying accident! His new film, <a href=#>The Iron Claw</a>, will release in theaters on Dec. 22, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfr66kecSfqaimXaW5or%2FToppmq6WntKa%2B2A%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./albert-lewis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Albert Lewis (American football)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-helen-baxendale-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Helen Baxendale Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
