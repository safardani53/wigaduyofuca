"Oh, like yesterday I saw a couple kids. I bought a couple bikes, a couple more scooters," he says with a smile.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And on the off chance that anyone would reject a gift from the Hall of Famer, O'Neal says he always gets parental approval beforehand. "Well, first I always tell them to ask their parents if they're going to take things from strangers," he explains. "You don't want kids to get used to having a stranger come up and say, 'Hey, I got a whole lot of money. Can I buy you something?' " O'Neal chuckles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Shaq Surprises Florida Police Officer and Kids with Pick-Up Basketball Game After Seeing Heartwarming Viral Video</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Having those moments with fans is important to O'Neal, who happily recalls "another really meaningful" interaction that helped a Texas family finding a missing loved one. "There was a homeless lady in front of one of my favorite restaurants in Texas called Bigs," O'Neal says. "And I just gave her a plate of food and somebody recorded it and posted it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">O'Neal's good deed had a much greater impact than just feeding an unhoused woman, though. "Her sister had come in crying to the owner, saying, 'Oh, my god, we've been looking for her for six months. We couldn't find her. We didn't know if anything was wrong with her.' They tried to take her to get help. She didn't want to get help, so she's still out there, but at least her sister knows where she is. Her sister could bring her clothes and water or something. But, when I do stuff like that, I never record it," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">O'Neal, along with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Shaquille O'Neal Foundation</a>, is keeping up his charitable ways as he prepares to host the non-profit's second annual fundraising gala in Las Vegas. Called The Event, it will take place on October 1 and features a star-studded lineup of performers, including <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Maren Morris</a>, Maroon 5 and John Mulaney.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm excited to announce the details for The Event," O'Neal tells PEOPLE. "This event is going to support the work that we do at the Shaquille O'Neal Foundation. Our main goal is to provide resources to kids in need, especially Las Vegas and Atlanta where I live at."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Shaquille O'Neal Foundation's mission is to create pathways for underserved youth to help them achieve their full potential. "It's all about kids, the resources that they made. I'm also part of our communities and schools, and we just do a lot," O'Neal says of his work with the foundation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Concert tickets range from $50 to $250 and go on sale to the public at 10 a.m. PT on Friday, August 19 via <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>AXS.com</a>. The evening will also include a private cocktail reception, dinner and live auction followed by a public performance.
