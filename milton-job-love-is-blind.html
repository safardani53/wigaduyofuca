While it's not often that contestants will bond over their jobs, <a href=#>Milton</a> and Lydia from Season 5 really seemed to hit it off when it came to talking about their respective fields. While <a href=#>Lydia confirmed she is a geologist</a>, what does Milton do for work? Here's what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Milton was making a six-figure salary while filming 'Love Is Blind,' but has since went back to school.</h2><p>Milton entered Love Is Blind at the age of 24. While he may have acted his age at times, he is actually very serious about his education and career.</p><p>Milton graduated from Quest Early College High School in 2016 and earned an associate's degree in mathematics from Lone Star College the same year, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>He then attended the University of Houston from 2016 to 2019, where he majored in petroleum and geotechnology. Milton then went on to get a master's degree from the University of Texas at El Paso in 2020. In 2023, Milton also started pursuing an MBA at Rice University, which he expects to complete in 2025.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>At the time of filming Love Is Blind, Milton worked as a senior pipeline control center operator at EverLine. And as his roommate Josh confirmed in Episode 6, he was making a six-figure salary at the time.</p><p>But in Nov. 2022, Milton actually switched jobs. He now works as a management trainee at Vopak while also studying at Rice. It's unclear if he is trying to pivot to a different career as he is pursuing his MBA, but his role at Vopak still falls within the oil and energy wheelhouse.</p><p>Clearly, he has a bright future ahead of him and appears to be serious about finding a partner who shares his values and goals. This may be why he decided to set his eyes on Lydia.</p><p>Watch Love Is Blind Season 5 on Netflix</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforatwM6nZKOnkmK5sMLEZqCsZZKhtq%2Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./billie-eilish-plays-sally-at-nightmare-before-christmas-concert.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Billie Eilish Plays Sally at 'Nightmare Before Christmas' Concert</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wendy-whoppers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wendy Whoppers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
