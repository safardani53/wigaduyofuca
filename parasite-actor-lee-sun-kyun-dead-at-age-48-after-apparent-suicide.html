Lee was found with a charcoal briquette in his passenger seat, per law enforcement.</p><p>The police started to search for Lee after he was reported missing. Several South Korean media outlets have reported that Lee’s death is being treated as a suicide. South Korea’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Yonhap News Agency</a> also reported on Wednesday that authorities have launched an investigation regarding his death.</p><p>Ahead of his passing, Lee was under investigation by police for allegations that he had used illegal drugs while at the home of a hostess working at a South Korean bar, according to a Wednesday report from Yonhap. Lee was first questioned by police in October regarding the drugs.</p><p>He apologized at the time for “causing immense disappointment,” the outlet reported. “I am sorry for my family, who are enduring extreme pain at this moment,” Lee said.</p><p>Lee has since maintained his innocence, however, claiming during various rounds of questioning that he was tricked into taking the drugs. According to Yonhap, he was most recently questioned on Saturday, December 23.</p><p>He tested negative in two drug tests following the initial incident, the outlet reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Parasite-Actor-Lee-Sun-kyun-Dead-At-Age-48-After-Apparent-Suicide.jpg><p>In the wake of the incident, Lee reportedly filed two complaints against the hostess, accusing her of blackmail.</p><p>Lee rose to global fame after starring as Park Dong-ik (Nathan) in <a href=#>the 2019 movie</a> Parasite. The film took home four <a href=#>Academy Awards</a> at the 2020 Oscars, becoming the first non-English-language film to win best picture.</p><p>Lee made his stage debut in 2001, starring as Brad Majors in a production of The Rocky Horror Show. His television debut came the following year in a show titled Lovers. His film debut also came in 2002 with roles in films including Make It Big, Surprise Party, A Perfect Match and Boss X-File.</p><p>Before his sudden passing, Lee spoke candidly about the future of his career, including his love of acting.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Because I’m an actor, I’m more used to successfully achieving acting when the role is given, instead of choosing what to do. But if I have an opportunity, I want to try superhero flicks, which I’ve recently been into,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Korean Herald</a> in August. “Acting is what powers me to grow and contemplate. I’m thankful that I’m doing this for a living.”</p><p>If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, call the <a href=# rel=noopener>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> at 988.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaKWwKrAxGaYnKyfp3qtscRmqq6mXaDGtrqMnZyanF2WwW6txp5kbXBdlrO1sdFmmKmokaeyr8CMrKyim5mZsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyler-duggar-what-happened-to-jim-bob-and-michelles-adopted-son.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Jim Bob and Michelle's Adopted Son?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-wolf-lydia-loves-stiles-season-6-episode-2-recap.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lydia Admits She Loves Stiles Season 6 Episode 2 Recap Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
