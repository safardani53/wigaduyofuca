The film was announced back in June 2021, and filming began that October in Los Angeles. So fans have been waiting a while to watch&nbsp;You People&nbsp;and they’re so excited for January 27!</p><h2>The Trailer</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Netflix released the <i>You People&nbsp;</i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>teaser trailer</a>&nbsp;on December 5, 2022. A month later, the streamer dropped the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official trailer</a>. It starts with Ezra’s father, Arnold, asking him if he has a girlfriend. Ezra vents that he’s “never going to meet a woman who understands me” — until he accidentally gets into Amira’s car, mistaking her for an Uber. They unexpectedly fall in love and Ezra is ready to propose, but first he has to meet Amira’s parents, Akbar and Fatima, who are immediately dissatisfied with Ezra. Meanwhile, Ezra’s parents, Shelley and Arnold Cohen, aren’t clicking with Amira, either. Eventually, Ezra and Amira bring their parents together and the cultural differences between the two families leads to so many hilarious moments.</p><h2>Cast and Crew</h2><h3>Cast</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jonah Hill and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lauren London</strong></a> star as Ezra and Amira, respectively. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nia Long</strong></a> and Eddie Murphy play Amira’s parents, Fatima and Akbar Mohammed. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>David Duchovny</a>&nbsp;</strong>play Ezra’s parents, Shelley and Arnold Cohen.

He and Jonah Hill also co-wrote the film and produced it with <strong>Kevin Misher</strong>. Kenya previously collaborated with Eddie Murphy on <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Coming 2 America</a>, which he co-wrote. Kenya is reportedly working on a modern remake of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Wizard of Oz</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The behind-the-scenes team on&nbsp;<i>You People&nbsp;</i>also includes <strong>Mark Doering-Powell&nbsp;</strong>as cinematographer,&nbsp;<strong>Jamie Nelsen </strong>as editor, and singer/record producer&nbsp;<strong>Bekon&nbsp;</strong>as the music composer.</p><h2>Plot Information</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Here’s Netflix’s official synopsis of&nbsp;You People: “A new couple and their families reckon with modern love amid culture clashes, societal expectations and generational differences.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Complex</a>, Kenya revealed how Jonah Hill’s relationship with a Cuban girl at the time sparked the idea for&nbsp;You People. “He was like, my mom, she comes over to my house and my mom makes arroz con pollo. And he’s like, what? But the thing is that as he’s realizing that—my kid’s mom is biracial—it’s not the people in the relationship that cause the thing, it’s the outside noise,” Kenya said. “And that was almost the conceit point for the movie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Kenya continued, “We started talking about it in general, the Jewish and Black culture often sometimes run into oppression Olympics and we loved the idea of that. So there were a lot of things that we wanted to talk about that we felt like would be interesting and hadn’t really been explored or would make it feel like it was of the time. We didn’t know how much of the time it would be at that moment, but we definitely wanted to talk about things that were in our heart.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9iorGaolaS9rbGMpqavoZVignF8l3Jramc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marty-smith-reporter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Marty Smith (reporter) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hunter-king-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Actress Hunter Kings Siblings Are Actress Like Her</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
