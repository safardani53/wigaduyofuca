Now, she’s opening up about how terrifying that was.</p><p>Almost 13 years ago, Jamie sabotaged her career and changed the course of her entire life by revealing that she was pregnant at 16.</p><p>This week, Jamie announced a Zoey 101 reunion … one with surprising guests like Noah Beck and JoJo Siwa.</p><p>Now, she is speaking to NYLON in a new profile, thinking back to her teen pregnancy … something that she only learned after auditioning for Twilight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"You have your first love, or what you call love in high school," Jamie Lynn recalls to <a href=#>NYLON</a>.</p><p>"You think it’s forever," she explains, "and then, oh my gosh, I’m pregnant."</p><p>Jamie Lynn narrates: "I am mortified to have to tell my parents this and my family this."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jamie Lynn says that she was thinking only of her family, adding: "I do not care what TMZ thinks about it."</p><p>She continues: "That was all I was thinking about: ‘These are the people I love that I have to tell, and also, I’m pregnant.’"</p><p>"’There’s a human being growing inside of me, and I’m so young, I’m almost a baby myself,’" Jamie Lynn recalls thinking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I didn’t really care about any of that nonsense," she emphasizes.</p><p>"But," she adds, "when we did announce that I was pregnant, I did hide away for a little bit during that time and I didn’t have a phone."</p><p>"But of course," Jamie Lynn laments, "the paparazzi still found me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"It’s not like I was in LA walking down the middle of the most popular boulevard," Jamie Lynn emphasizes. "I was in the middle of nowhere Mississippi."</p><p>She also stresses that Zoey 101 was coming to an end already — that it had nothing to do with her pregnancy.</p><p>These days, that could be something explained to the world via a single tweet. Way back when, in 2008, it was harder for stars to speak directly to fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I didn’t become pregnant until probably six months after we wrapped or something like that," Jamie Lynn shares.</p><p>"But," she notes, "some of the episodes had not aired yet."</p><p>Yes; some of us remember gathering with college friends and making moderately funny pregnancy puns as episodes of Zoey 101 aired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I think that there was a conversation with Nickelodeon, rightfully so, of, ‘Do we air these episodes?’" Jamie Lynn suggests.</p><p>"But the show had already wrapped," she adds, "and there was never a negotiation to go into any more seasons."</p><p>Simply put, Zoey explains: "We were too old. It was done."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So she moved to her hometown in Louisiana, purchased her own house, and lived there after giving birth.</p><p>"I put a big gate up around it, and I was like, ‘I’m going to stay here, raise my baby, and figure this out because this is real life,’" she recalls.</p><p>Jamie Lynn adds: "’I’ve put myself in this situation, I’m not condoning it or saying it’s right, but these are the cards that I have to play.’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"And I tried to do the best that I could," Jamie Lynn asserts.</p><p>"And yet, sure enough," she expresses, "everywhere I went in Mississippi for that whole nine months, there was always paparazzi on me everywhere I went."</p><p>"But I just knew that if I just stayed away from it long enough," Jamie Lynn notes, "that I could give my child some sense of normalcy back in her life."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jamie Lynn reveals that, shortly before learning that she was pregnant, she auditioned for the first Twilight film — for the role of Bella Swan.</p><p>"They had to force me. Force me," she characterizes.</p><p>"I remember just thinking like, ‘Y’all are insane. I’m not playing a vampire. That is so stupid. Why would I do that?’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For the record, Twilight has many serious flaws in terms of story, worldbuilding, and messaging … but in general, vampire media can be extremely good.</p><p>"But I went and read for that role," Jamie Lynn recalls. "I remember sitting in this little room, and I think Lily Collins was there, and I felt so sick."</p><p>"Little did I know, I was pregnant," she concludes.</p><a href=#><img width=2148 height=1820 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/britney-spears-stans-accuse-singers-team-of-orchestrating-a-cove.jpg alt="Britney Spears Fans Accuse Her Team of Orchestrating Cover-Up, Faking Pics & Videos" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Britney Spears Fans Accuse Her Team of Orchestrating Cover-Up, Faking Pics & Videos</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2Z9cLbApqCeZZyuu6950qmcmqqjYrZuw8CsZK2doqe2p7XEnWStp12psq24jKawZqiRp7KvwNJmoGavkah6sb7EoKVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joanna-gaines-designed-holiday-decor-is-here-shop-her-pieces.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joanna Gaines' Christmas Decorations: Shop Magnolia!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fashion-designer-leather-bag-sale-kate-spade.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fashion fans rush to buy designer leather bag for the lowest price of the year - shoppers say it's '</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
