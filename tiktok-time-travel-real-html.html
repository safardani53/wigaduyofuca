For instance, <a href=# rel=follow>TikTok</a>,&nbsp;the online video sharing platform, is filled with self-claimed&nbsp;time travelers who insist they are sharing their videos from the future.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But are these TikTok&nbsp;self-claimed time travelers real? Here are the 5 most&nbsp;bizarre time travelers and their predictions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>'aesthetictimewarper'</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>A TikTok user, who goes by the username @aesthetictimewarper and account name&nbsp;Aery Yormany, claims that they are&nbsp;from the year 2714.</p><p></p><p><strong>'aesthetictimewarper' claims to be a real-time traveler.</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The content creator has not revealed their identity, including gender, but predicts that&nbsp;the little green men from outer space will land during the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Perseid meteor shower</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In their most recent TikTok video, they write, "Many of you still don't believe I am a time traveler from the year 2714. Here is what will happen in your lifetime."</p><p>The user continues to predict that an alien slime-like organism would be&nbsp;released from a Russian facility in 2023, which could take over our bodies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But none of their prediction has come true so far, which had led many TikTok users to believe they are fake.</p><h2>'unicosobreviviente'</h2><p>Another TikTok user who claims to be the last remaining survivor on Earth, living&nbsp;in the year 2027, is @unicosobreviviente. His name on his profile reads as "Javier."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Javier posts his videos&nbsp;without showing his face or sharing details about his identity, while his username "unicosobreviviente" means&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lone survivor</a>” in&nbsp;Spanish. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In one of his videos, he explained that he found out&nbsp;everyone else in the world had disappeared&nbsp;after waking up in a hospital. He, thus, claimed to be in a&nbsp;parallel world and not being a time traveler.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He usually shows himself walking around historical and local places in Spain with completely no existence of other people around him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>'authentictimetraveler'</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Another&nbsp;self-claimed time traveler from the year 2582 is&nbsp;@authentictimetraveler. He has been in the spotlight since his video, where he had&nbsp;predicted that&nbsp;a new planet would be discovered on May 8, 2021, went viral.</p><p>In the video, he stated that&nbsp;astronauts would find another planet with similar qualities to Earth.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Attention. This video is not a joke. I am a real time traveler from the year 2582. On May 8th, 2021, astronauts will discover a planet exactly like Earth in our solar system. It will be an exact clone of our Earth, with a mirrored effect. This is the first time we find other human life in the galaxy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But since May 8, 2021, has already passed, and no such discovery was noted, he is likely to be another person trying to scam others with his false prediction videos.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>'2028man' and '2029man'</h2><p>Two men,&nbsp;2028man and&nbsp;2029man, who claim to be from the years 2028 and 2029, have been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">predicting&nbsp;activities</a>&nbsp;set to happen in the present day&nbsp;through TikTok. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Both of them declared by the mid-2020 that the&nbsp;2020 US election would end with Joe Biden winning and&nbsp;Donald Trump having to be removed from office. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They have several similarities as well, as both use the account name 'The Messenger' and hashtag #lenoxteam253, while&nbsp;2028man posted his first video on June 15, 2029man&nbsp;posted his first video on June 16. They also claim that they were sent back to 2020 to change things.</p><h2>Are They Real?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>With most of them opting not to reveal their real identity, it creates doubt about their&nbsp;authenticity. In addition, most of their claims are baseless, and some claims have also proven out to be wrong.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Hence, believing they are real might be a bad idea. But if you are looking to feed yourself with&nbsp;groundless theories about the future, you know where to head now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyZoMGwt4ytoKadXam%2FosLEpWSrnZGhe6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-jenner-totally-hooking-up-with-ben-flajnik.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Totally Hooking Up with Ben Flajnik!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drinker-bites-head-off-snake-pub.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sick drinker bites head off pet snake 'in front of children' in pub leaving staff 'distraught'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
