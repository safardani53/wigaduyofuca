If they chose option A, the parents-to-be would tell one another the baby’s gender or share it with close friends and relatives.</p><p>However, over the years, parents have become more comfortable revealing their child’s gender to any stranger with access to their social media accounts.</p><p style=text-align:left>As we continue into the age of “it didn’t happen if you didn’t post it,” some content creators feel more and more pressured to turn up the volume when events like <a href=#>gender reveals</a> take place.</p><p>In December 2023, one couple on <a href=#>TikTok</a> celebrated their third baby’s gender with an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ice bath</a>, which they placed outside in the snow. And, to add more insanity, it wasn’t the mom-to-be's first time freezing on camera.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A husband and wife sat in an ice bath wearing shorts and a dress for their baby’s gender reveal.</h2><p>While I’ve seen some extravagant gender reveals online, I’ve never been to one in person. If I were TikTok user Kya’s friend, I probably would’ve kept my no-gender reveal streak because me and below-freezing temperatures just don’t mix.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kya, who goes by @itskyajeub</a> on TikTok, isn’t afraid of getting a little chilly, and neither is her husband, Micah. In Kya’s December 2023 TikTok, the couple uses a weight to break down the thick ice covering their gender-reveal ice bath. The ice bath was outside, and the ground and trees were covered in snow.</p><p>As Micah wore a blue shirt and shorts for “Team Boy,” he broke down the ice with a dumbbell. Eventually, he moved onto his hands, and Kya, wearing a pink dress for “Team Girl,” took over and got rid of the ice. As they’re both only wearing socks, Kya says on camera, “That’s a lot of ice.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@itskyajeub href=#>@itskyajeub</a><p>ITS A….. <a title=genderreveal href=#>#genderreveal</a> <a title=boyorgirl href=#>#boyorgirl</a> <a title=guess href=#>#guess</a> <a title=surprise href=#>#surprise</a> <a title=mom href=#>#mom</a> <a title=dad href=#>#dad</a> <a title=icebath href=#>#icebath</a> <a title=icequeen href=#>#icequeen</a> <a title=coldplunge href=#>#coldplunge</a> <a title=fun href=#>#fun</a> <a title=family href=#>#family</a> <a title=hubby href=#>#hubby</a> <a title=parents href=#>#parents</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Ice Queen" href=#>♬ original sound - Ice Queen</a></figure><p>Indeed, it was a lot of ice. So much so that I hoped Micah and Kya would change their minds and just send everyone the baby’s gender via text. But nope. Micah and Kya followed their plan, stating they “should do more ice baths like this.”</p><p>Kya and Micah then stepped into their ice bath, laughing and screaming simultaneously as their family cheered them on. After a few seconds of sitting in the freezing water, Micah dropped a food coloring tablet that turned the water pink.</p><p>Kya momentarily looked away from the camera and screamed when she realized the water was pink. She and Micah hugged and stood in the water as their family clapped and popped pink confetti outside.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@itskyajeub</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kya’s TikTok commenters discovered she’s not new to taking ice baths on the app.</h2><p>While Kya and Micah’s ice bath gender reveal wasn’t the most ridiculous gender reveal I’ve seen, there are some pretty wild ones. However, theirs required a diligence that I just don’t possess and would never fathom doing while pregnant. They both have all of my respect.</p><p>Neither Kya nor her family considered her ice bath a big deal, but not because they’re more tolerant of freezing temperatures. Kya’s TikTok page shows she routinely sits in ice baths and has shared her journey as the “Ice Queen” on her platform.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@itskyajeub href=#>@itskyajeub</a><p>Drop your GIRL NAME suggestions below!!💕 <a title=names href=#>#names</a> <a title=girlnames href=#>#girlnames</a> <a title=girl href=#>#girl</a> <a title=pink href=#>#pink</a> <a title=pregnancy href=#>#pregnancy</a> <a title=pregnancyupdate href=#>#pregnancyupdate</a> <a title=icebath href=#>#icebath</a> <a title=coldplunge href=#>#coldplunge</a> <a title=pregnant href=#>#pregnant</a> <a title=ice href=#>#ice</a> <a title=22weekspregnant href=#>#22weekspregnant</a> <a title=bumpdate href=#>#bumpdate</a> <a title=namesuggestions href=#>#namesuggestions</a></p><a title="♬ Girls Like Me Don't Cry (Remix) - thuy" href=#>♬ Girls Like Me Don't Cry (Remix) - thuy</a></figure><p>In one post, Kya celebrated achieving <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one year of taking ice baths</a> and claimed the baths, which are known to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several health benefits</a>, are “not that complicated.” I’ll believe you from a distance, girlfriend.</p><p>Although Kya isn’t new to ice baths, those unfamiliar with her brand were concerned about her taking one during her gender reveal.
