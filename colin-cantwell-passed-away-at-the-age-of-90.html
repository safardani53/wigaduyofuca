He went on to study at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he recommended that the university establish an animation department. Cantwell went on to become UCLA’s first animation graduate.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Colin-Cantwell-2.jpg alt="Colin Cantwell" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cantwell spent much of the 1960s and 1970s working on both real-life NASA missions to explore the final frontier and sci-fi fantasies about what may be out there.&nbsp;Cantwell had a good career before moving to Hollywood. Cantwell worked at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where she created public education programs to assist people to comprehend space travel.&nbsp;Cantwell would go on to create numerous iconic sequences in several science fiction films, merging his architectural and space interests. Among his contributions to 2001: A Space Odyssey were the ideas for the film’s dramatic opening scene.</p><p>He stated:</p><p>“I worked closely with Stanley Kubrick and convinced him that the film should not begin with a 20-minute conference table debate.”</p><p>After viewing his work on the spaceship in 2001 and serving as a technical dialogue consultant for Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1973, he received a call from George Lucas asking him to be a concept artist for Star Wars.&nbsp;All of the spacecraft portrayed in the iconic 1977 film, from the X-Wing fighter and Rebel cruisers to the Star Destroyers and Death Star, were based on his prototype designs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Colin-Cantwell-3.jpg alt="Colin Cantwell" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cantwell claims that the X-Wing was inspired by the back end of a dart he threw while out at a bar, while the Death Star’s trench, which Luke Skywalker flies down to destroy, was inspired by a touch of sloth.&nbsp;His influence on the Star Wars brand cannot be understated, since his work defined the franchise’s design goals, which are still relevant today thanks to fresh concepts brought in programs like The Mandalorian.&nbsp;Colin, on the other hand, did not stop there. In 1983, he worked as a computer programmer on John Badham’s Cold War thriller WarGames.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaqKSZo3qkrc2trp6knGK9or%2FSnptmmaeWxm6t02aroZ1dlrSmec6fZHJoXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dakota-johnson-prioritizes-sleep-8415047.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dakota Johnson Says Sleep Is 'Number One Priority in Life'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-miscarriage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonc on Her Miscarriages New 'Elle' Tell-All Interview</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
