From teddies to slip dresses, corsets and camisoles, there are seemingly endless variations of cuts and designs to choose from. "We find that detailed embellishments in bra and panty sets are popular," says Sapna Palep, CEO of Journelle. "Bodysuits are hot right now, [as well as] Italian nightie styles that are short and flirty." However, your personal style will dictate which styles of lingerie look and feel best on you.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Accessibility</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Styles will change according to accessibility too, and we are firm believers that everyone should be able to celebrate their bodies — no matter what your needs are. Women who have undergone breast surgeries will need specific styles separate from what are readily available on the market, which the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">AnaOno Gloria Soft Lace Bralette</a> is here to do.

Your personal style and your needs can be met all in one with fabulous lingerie, no matter your body type.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like picking out any bra, it's important to be measured correctly at a fitting to be sure which size of lingerie you should buy. "Not all brands run the same, so it's important to have an expert bra fitting and know your own measurements," Palep advises. From there, you can read each brand's measurement chart on their site and compare them to your own to decipher your best size.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nobody likes a digging bra strap or underwire that pokes, so it's imperative that you take comfort into consideration when looking for your new pieces. Andrea Jagaric, Chief Design Officer for Aerie, Offline and Unsubscribed, feels that fashion should meet functionality when it comes to intimates. "In the industry today, we see women prioritize comfort and therefore have further invested in bras and bralettes with that in mind," Jagaric says. "As a leader in comfort, we continue to innovate our intimates to bring our community the best and celebrate our bodies and our real selves."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lingerie can range from several price points, but you'll find most to be on the higher side. "A quality lingerie set uses high-end fabrics. Look for well made, quality styles that fit, support and are comfortable on your skin," Palep shares. "True quality isn't necessarily cheap." While you can score some festive finds for less than $20, like this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">lace corset</a> from Target, you'll often find much better stitching, softer fabrics, more seamless padding, and other high-end qualities when buying lingerie from more luxurious retailers like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">La Perla</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">For Love and Lemons</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>FAQs</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What type of lingerie should I buy?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's completely up to you which kind of lingerie you choose to invest in, but what matters most is what makes you feel confident and comfortable. If you want to accentuate a certain area of your body, like your chest, then a push-up bra or fun bustier could be an option for you. On the other hand, if you feel best in looser-fitting lingerie that flutters around, then you may want to opt for a babydoll or slip nightgown. There are plenty of options to choose from, so be adventurous and have fun.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I know what size(s) I should buy?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Size is what you feel good in first," Jagaric answers. Figuring out your best fit will always be going into a store to have a proper bra fitting, but Aerie offers a fit-finder technology that allows you to figure out your correct size from home in every single one of their product descriptions. You can also go by "sister sizing" if your normal size is sold out. "Go up a band size and down a cup size: If you usually wear a 34C, try a 36B. If you usually wear a 36D, try a 34DD," Aerie's measurement chart explains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can I style lingerie in my outfits?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your lingerie shouldn't only be stylish, but also functional in your everyday life — so it's worth considering how you can style it in your wardrobe, as well. "Your lingerie can always be incorporated into your outfits when you have beautiful styles that are meant to be seen," Palpa says. "Look for fun colors – whether subtle or bold, [like] detailed straps, lacy cups, embellishments and extras in your bras, bodysuits, [and] bustiers to peek through to accentuate any outfit."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It can be hard to picture this in your mind's eye, so celebrity stylist Mary Fellowes has a few suggestions to illustrate these ideas:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Blazers:</strong> "I love a blazer or tux for the evening where it is buttoned on the midriff to show a peek of bra," Fellowes says.
