[His mother] Irmelin [Indenbirken] let me stay at his beach house in Malibu for a weekend,” she recalled on the episode. “I was dating somebody who was living in Canada, having a long-distance relationship, and he came to town and they let me have the beach house and I didn’t tell him where we were going.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leonardo-DiCaprio-Home-Was-Decorated-With-Titanic-Items-Promo.jpg><p>Weaver continued, “And we walked in and you walk into this beach house and <a href=#>everything was Titanic</a>. Titanic towels, Titanic poster, Titanic, you know, everywhere. And so [my then-boyfriend] did look at me and he was like, ’Is this Leo’s house?’ Yes. That’s Leo‘s house. So … that was pretty amazing.”</p><p>The Flipping Out star said that she didn’t believe DiCaprio’s home would be decorated in that way now, noting that the film wasn’t “that old” during the time she had stayed over.</p><p>“It was also not his main house … and he hardly went there. So I think it was probably his mom who did it, but it was a dead giveaway,” she shared. “I remember it was the best bed I’ve ever slept in my life. I had to, like, look at the mattress and see what kind of mattress it was.”</p><p>Weaver said that the Titanic-themed decor was “very tasteful, but there were like dead giveaways with the Titanic towels and robes and the poster of Leo.” She regarded it as “pretty fun” overall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leonardo-DiCaprio-Home-Was-Decorated-With-Titanic-Items-Inline.jpg><p>The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor, 46, starred in the <a href=#><strong>James Cameron</strong></a>-directed movie alongside <a href=#><strong>Kate Winslet</strong></a>. The film follows Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet); two people from differing social classes who fall in love aboard the RMS Titanic — a real-life ship that sank in the Atlantic Ocean in April 1912.</p><p>The acclaimed flick won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Visual Effects.</p><p>DiCaprio and Winslet, who later starred in Revolutionary Road together in 2008, <a href=#>have remained close friends</a> since the movie debuted. Speaking to <a href=#>Glamour UK</a> in 2017, the Holiday actress, 45, dished on what the pair’s dynamic is like.</p><p>“You don’t even want to know the last conversation we had, because it was so funny and made me laugh so much,” she said of their hangouts. “We found ourselves saying to each other, ‘Can you imagine if the world really knew the stupid things we say?’ I’m not going to tell you what we actually talk about, but yeah, we’re very, very close and sometimes we do quote the odd Titanic line back and forth to each other, because only we can, and we find it really funny.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leonardo-DiCaprio-Home-Was-Decorated-With-Titanic-Items-Inline-2.jpg><p>While their friendship has persisted over the years, debates surrounding <a href=#>the movie’s ending</a> have also continued. While waiting to be rescued after the ship crashed, Jack rested his arm on a door that Rose laid on top. Jack died since his body was primarily in the freezing Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Winslet said on <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> in 2016 that she believes that Jack “could have actually fit on that bit of door.” However, when <a href=#>MTV News</a> asked DiCaprio about the controversial moment in 2019, he repeatedly said: “I have no comment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZ%2BjrrOwzmabopuRpb%2Bqu4ydnJynopbBprCMoaCsZZikuqZ51qKroWWknsGiusicZKKslaLAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-wolf-lydia-loves-stiles-season-6-episode-2-recap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lydia Admits She Loves Stiles Season 6 Episode 2 Recap Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wendi-nix-espn-husband-dating-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Deep Dive Into ESPN's Wendi Nix's Life From Bio and Career To Husband and Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
