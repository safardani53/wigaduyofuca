I'm short, leave me alone. I attract creeps, a**holes and idiots," she said during a teaser for the rest of the season that aired on tonight episode.</p><p>The reality star admitted: "It is scary to put myself out there, but you have to put some risk in to get happiness."</p><p>Shauna Rae's stature makes lots of things difficult for her, including dating.</p><p>She explained on the show: “I’m 22 years old. My height is 3 feet 10 inches and my weight is 50 pounds. I physically am in the body of an 8-year-old. I can’t drive. I can’t reach counters. I have to hop on couches and beds.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>In episode two, Shauna will be going on blind dates.</p><p>It's unclear, based on the teaser, how <a href=#>Shauna Rae</a>'s quest to find romance will play out.</p><p>However, she can be seen going on an axe-throwing date with a man she just met.</p><h2>THE SHOW</h2><p>I Am Shauna Rae is <a href=#>a documentary series</a> about the star's life, her struggles, and more.</p><p>Because of her stature, Shauna Rae is often confused for a child.</p><p>This makes dating hard, as well as doing normal things 20-somethings do, like going to bars.</p><p>In the trailer for the show, Shauna introduces herself saying: "If you were to look at me, you would think I'm just a normal little girl, doing normal little girl things with my fun, crazy family."</p><p>She added: "But the truth is I'm not a little girl. I'm a woman, a 22-year-old woman stuck in the body of an eight-year-old."</p><p>The trailer teased an array of tribulations, like getting turned away from a bar, with the bartender saying: "We don't allow kids."</p><p>Shauna's also shown trying to get a tattoo, going to an adult toy store and being questioned about her age while signing up for a gym.</p><p>The show features members of Shauna's family, including mom Patricia "Patty" Schrankel.</p><p>In the show, her mom speaks about the difficulty of watching her daughter battle brain cancer as a child.</p><p>"Shauna was six months old when we found out she had brain cancer," she recalled. "I feel, I guess almost guilty, that she will have to go through this for the rest of her life, so all I can do is protect her."</p><p>Shauna explains in the show what happened to her.</p><p>"My pituitary gland was rendered almost dormant because of the chemotherapy. The doctor told me I was done growing. My bones were fused, and my height is 3 feet and 10 inches," Shauna shared.</p><p>Her goal is to one day be seen as independent from her family.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I can't go anywhere without them asking questions," she says in the trailer.</p><p>Patty says at one point in the preview: "I don't know if I am ready to let her go, but she needs to be let go."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000700816584.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000700816477-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000700816474.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Girl, 22, 'stuck in 8-year-old's body' pole dances, drinks, and gets tattoo in attempt to live normal adult life</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZGmBdoKUaKBmmZ1iwKmt1KeYZqqRmnq0wMCrZJqspKeupMDSZp2rnZGgwG7A0bKgp59dma61sY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-gomez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Gomez</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gaspard-ulliels-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gaspard Ulliels Girlfriend: Who is Gaspard Ulliel Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
