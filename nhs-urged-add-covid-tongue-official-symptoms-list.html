which is currently a fever, a new and persistent cough and a loss of taste or smell - they must order a test and self-isolate.</p><p>These steps are designed to help prevent the spread of the virus.</p><p>Prof Spector told <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">MailOnline</a>: "We're still missing 35 per cent of cases that have symptoms that aren't in the NHS 111 list which is the briefest list in the world."</p><p>Anyone with the ZOE Covid Symptom app can get a free test if they have any of symptoms - not just the NHS approved ones, Prof Spector added.</p><h2>RED ALERT</h2><p>Experts first said&nbsp;<a href=#>skin rashes in the mouth</a>&nbsp;should be recognised as an important sign of Covid-19 back in September.</p><p>Researchers examined 666 patients at a temporary field hospital that had been set up at the peak of the pandemic in Madrid, Spain.</p><p>Experts revealed that 46 per cent of patients had some form of skin rash, with the hands and feet being particularly affected.</p><p>They also found that 26 per cent of patients had a rash inside the mouth and small bumps were the most common sign.</p><p>The experts added that skin rashes were ‚Äúrelatively uncommon‚Äù with just 11 per cent of participants experiencing this.</p><p>King‚Äôs College London has also called for skin rashes to be considered as the&nbsp;<a href=#>fourth official coronavirus symptom</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CM-GRAPHIC-COVID-SYMPTOMS-v2.jpg><p>Researchers said they identified eight different types of skin rash which could be a potential sign of&nbsp;<a href=#>Covid-19</a>.</p><p>Rashes are twice as common in children as in adults and may be a better predictor of needing a swab test than a fever or cough, they said.</p><p>According to the data, rashes may appear before, during or after the presence of other Covid symptoms and sometimes many weeks later.</p><p>Rashes were also the only sign of infection for 21 per cent of people with a positive nasal swab.</p><p>Gabriel Scally, a public health physician and president of epidemiology and public health at Royal Society of Medicine, told The Sun: "Symptoms in the mouth have been described for some time in association with Covid-19.</p><p>"It is such a problematic virus to treat as it produces effects in such a wide range of body systems."</p><p>The symptom shown in the photo was not described in medical terms by Prof Spector.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000514574901.jpg><p>Prof Scally said: "The medical name for an acute swelling of the tongue that occurs as part of a syndrome is 'glossitis'.</p><p>"It can also involve discolouration and can also be known, more popularly than medically, as 'strawberry tongue' or 'raspberry tongue' in these cases.</p><p>"It can occur in a wide range of conditions."</p><p>Certain diseases that affect the immune system may attack the tongue, including herpes.</p><p>Changes in the tongue, including pain, discolouration, swelling or a strange texture, are sometimes the result of an underlying condition.</p><p>But it can also be the result of poor mouth hygiene, smoking or an unhealthy diet.</p><p>A white or "furry" tongue is often caused by coating of debris, bacteria and dead cells.</p><p>But it could be a sign of a health condition, for example oral thrush, and the NHS advises seeing a GP about it.</p><p>Mouth ulcers are very common and can be caused by a range of things, including hot food or drink, medicines, stress, hormonal changes or vitamin deficiencies.</p><h2>What are the strange symptoms of Covid?</h2><p>Prof Spector warned his followers: "If you have a strange symptom or even just headache and fatigue stay at home!"</p><p>The Covid Symptom Study app, developed by ZOE and used by KCL for research, is a phone app used by millions of people in the UK.</p><p>Users report if they have symptoms of the coronavirus and if they have been tested for the disease.</p><p>It helps the researchers identify symptoms that are common in people who have a positive Covid test result, as well as track the size of the outbreak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/covidtonguesymptomprofspectorthesun2.png><p>KCL have discovered a handful of symptoms that are not on the official NHS list -
