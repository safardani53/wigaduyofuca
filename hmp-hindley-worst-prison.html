prisons in the UK.</p><p>The prison has made headlines for its deplorable treatment of its inmates, with violence and drug-taking a regular occurrence behind bars.</p><p>Having operated as a detention centre or jail for more than half a century, what went so wrong?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000264350573.jpg><h2>When did the prison in Hindley open?</h2><p>Hindley prison was originally opened as a borstal - a type of youth detention centre &nbsp;- in 1961.</p><p>The site has been reclassified a number of times, with it now used as a site for&nbsp;Young Offenders and Adult Male Category C.</p><p>Currently operated by HM Prison Services, the site has seven units including&nbsp;Alder, Beech, Cedar, Dove, Elm, Fir and Juniper.</p><h2>Where is HMP Hindley?</h2><p>HMP Hindley sits in the Greater Manchester area, with the prison in the village of Bickershaw, near Wigan.</p><p>The prison is on Gibson Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/composite-hmp-hindley.jpg><h2>How many inmates are at the jail?</h2><p>The prison houses males who have been sentenced to four years or less behind bars.</p><p>Young men between 18 and 21-years-old are also sent to the jail if&nbsp;given sentences of more than 12 months and up to four years.</p><p>The Ministry of Justice has said the prison has a capacity of 664, as of August 2015.</p><p>According to the latest report into the jail's conditions, the jail held 515 inmates as of July 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000285544788.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000264350565.jpg><h2>Why has the regime been criticised?</h2><p>A watchdog report has slammed the prison, with a damning account&nbsp;saying it was "one of the worst and possibly one of the very worst that inspectors had ever seen in this type of prison".</p><p>The independent inspection of the prison found that inmates were locked in their cells for more than 24 hours at a time.</p><p>Inmates also told inspectors that it was easier to get illegal drugs than clean clothes while regular fights broke out.</p><p>Those kept at the site were also given mouldy bread and other below average meals.</p><p>A report found: "The length of time for which young adults and adults alike were locked up was, in our considered view, unnecessary, unjustifiable and counterproductive.</p><p>"Almost every aspect of prison life was adversely affected by the regime."</p><p>The report also found that prisoners struggled to get showers, clean clothing and bedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000285544784.jpg><p>The news come as concerns were raised <a href=#>about the high rate of suicides in jails.</a></p><p>It comes as prisoners in one UK jail <a href=#>boasted of being able to eat McDonald's and throwing wild parties in jail.</a></p><p>Others took to social media saying <a href=#>how they loved the "delightful cuisine" served up during their time behind bars.</a></p><h2>What does the prison service have to say?</h2><p>Michael&nbsp;Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said: "Since the inspection a detailed improvement plan was developed to address the weaknesses identified by inspectors and this is being closely monitored.</p><p>"Progress has been made to improve safety and purposeful activity with more prisoners engaged in high quality work and training opportunities.</p><p>"Additional staff have been transferred into the prison to support the improvements required and the governor is working closely with Greater Manchester Police to tackle gang behaviour and violence in the prison."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a
