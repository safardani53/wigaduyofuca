The Tony Award nominee has major support in his career from his girlfriend, actress and writer <strong>Schuyler Helford</strong>, 31. Before he met Schuyler, Josh dated several famous women including <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>January Jones</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katy Perry,</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kat Dennings</strong></a>. Here’s everything you need to know about Josh’s relationship with Schuyler, and his past romances.</p><h2>Schuyler Helford</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Schuyler-Helford-and-Josh-Groban-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Josh and Schuyler started dating sometime in 2017, but they didn’t confirm their romance until the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2018 Tony Awards</a>. The couple made their red carpet debut at the event and happily posed for photos together. Schuyler is an actress known for her recurring role in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong></a>‘s Fox sitcom&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Call Me Kat</a>. She’s also appeared on Anger Management&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Middle.&nbsp;As a writer, she’s worked on the shows #Cybriety&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Indoorsy&nbsp;</i>and the 2017 CBS Diversity Sketch Comedy Showcase, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. Schuyler’s dad is television writer/producer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bruce Helford</strong></a>, 70.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Josh and Schuyler have kept their romance under wraps since they started dating. They rarely post about each other on their Instagram pages, though Schuyler did notably <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>document the couple’s vacation</a> to Disneyland way back in December 2019. She shared a photo of herself and Josh posing together at the iconic amusement park. These two are so in love!</p><h2>January Jones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/january-jones-and-Josh-Groban-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Josh’s first high-profile relationship was with actress January Jones, 44. Josh dated January from 2003 to 2006, before she starred in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mad Men.&nbsp;</a>They attended numerous public events together including the 2004 American Music Awards and the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. Seven years after their split, Josh opened up about the romance in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an interview</a> with Details magazine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“We dated for about two and a half years, and we were madly in love. It was definitely my longest relationship,” Josh said in the Feb. 2013 interview. The “You Raise Me Up” singer added, “I’d love to get into another serious relationship. I am a real romantic at heart.”</p><h2>Katy Perry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/katy-perry-and-Josh-Groban-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Josh indeed started dating again after he and January called it quits. He briefly dated Katy Perry, 38, in 2009. Josh addressed his relationship with Katy in the 2013&nbsp;Details&nbsp;interview, revealing that they “might have skated on the line of dating.” Josh then insisted that he and Katy were “just friends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In 2017, Katy revealed during a live stream that her iconic song “The One That Got Away” was in fact about Josh. Josh confirmed he dated Katy and reacted to her shocking confession on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a>&nbsp;the following year.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“We were both very private, so we realized we’re better as friends. We’ve been very good friends to this day, she’s the best,” Josh said. “But I was not expecting that,” he added of Katy’s revelation in her live stream. “That was a double take and a spit of my coffee when I saw that. It’s very sweet of her to say that, and then I listened to the lyrics of the song, and I’m just like, ‘I never owned a mustang. I don’t have a tattoo. Are you sure that’s about me?’ I’m very flattered by it, but I was very surprised by it too.”</p><h2>Kat Dennings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kate-dennings-and-Josh-Groban-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Josh’s most serious relationship before Schuyler was with actress Kat Dennings, 36. They made their first public appearance together as a couple in&nbsp;October 2014 at the Beverly Hills Carousel of Hope Ball. The following year, Josh gushed over his relationship with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2 Broke Girls</a>&nbsp;star on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>. Josh explained how he and Kat bonded over humor, saying, “Humor is such a huge thing for me, so, you know, the fact that we could talk about Monty Python and all sorts of weird other things, I was like, ‘Okay yeah, we’re on the same page.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>After two years of dating, Josh and Kat broke up in August 2016. “It was a mutual breakup,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>&nbsp;at the time. “They are still friends and care about each other, but it’s not the right time for them now as a couple,” the insider added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8moqqFll6e8o63NZq6inpVigXqElW9vaWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./honey-boo-boo-boyfriend-family-beach-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Honey Boo Boo With Boyfriend &amp;amp; Family At Beach: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christine-brown-emphasizes-engagement-reveals-super-sweet-note-left-by-flight-attendant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christine Brown Emphasizes Engagement, Reveals Super Sweet Note Left By Flight Attendant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
