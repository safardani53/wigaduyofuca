The series&nbsp;is an adaptation of Hall's play, Pussy Valley,&nbsp;which follows the lives of the workers at a strip club in the Mississippi Delta.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The series premiered on Starz on July 12, 2020, and was renewed for a second season two weeks after its premiere. The actress received a positive response from the critics for her performance as the gem-faced exotic dancer in the show.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As Mississippi, Thornton plays the sweet stripper with obvious good looks. She is known for her exotic appearance and even has a unique way of putting on her makeup.</p><p>During her December 2020 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Essence</a>, the actress revealed she wanted to become a fashion illustrator when she stepped into "the difficult and complicated" New York entertainment industry.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She shared her beauty essentials and disclosed some of her top tips to look glamorous at all times.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Shannon Thornton On Skincare</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Thornton revealed being "really big" about investing in facials and chemical peels to keep her skin clear because of her acne-prone, oily skin.&nbsp;</p><p>During filming, she had to show up in a lot of makeup&nbsp;and dance simultaneously, every day for several months. They were working 16 hours per day, which sometimes resulted in many breakouts on her skin.&nbsp;</p><p>"To calm all the breakouts, a facial was very much needed, and it made such a difference," she added. "Staying away from dairy&nbsp;really helped with those hormonal breakouts around the chin and jawline." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Shannon Thornton On Becoming Mississippi</h2><p>Mississippi's style and looks&nbsp;were inspired by actual photos of Thornton pulled out from her Instagram account. Mississippi is younger in age than Thornton, and her&nbsp;style is wild, young, and very childlike.</p><p>According to the Connecticut native, playing&nbsp;around with eyeshadows and liners would be essential&nbsp;to accentuate Mississippi's&nbsp;eye makeup to achieve big, doll-like eyes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The "nude lips and experimental eye shadow" look is Mississippi's most iconic look, Thornton said. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The nude lip was pretty consistent throughout the first season, and you just see her playing around a lot with cut creases and little sparkles. We’ll play around with glitter and little stones on my eyebrow, or something like that for fun.</p><p>However, Thornton expressed she does not like to go heavy on&nbsp;makeup when she isn't playing Mississippi.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’ll pencil in my eyebrows and put on some mascara and lip gloss, and I’m fine," she stated.&nbsp;"Finally,&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;some shimmer powder to highlight my cheekbones and the bridge of my nose."</p><h2>Important Lessons from Mississippi</h2><p>Thornton revealed that one of the biggest things she learned from the people she worked with and the character she played is&nbsp;how beautiful and empowering it is to own your sexuality and how it’s okay to be sexy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>We’re playing sex workers and there’s this huge stigma behind the word 'stripper'&nbsp;when in reality this is labor for these women.</p><p>The work of a stripper is "just like any other job," she added. Thornton&nbsp;also shared her reluctance when she was first offered the role in the series because she was afraid of being judged.</p><p>She concluded the interview&nbsp;with a positive message for everyone to enjoy the moment without the fear of being judged so that they, too, could be sexy and confident, like Mississippi.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuYlruvu81mq6GnoqPBsLqMmp6eZZ6qsaZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-peter-miller-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Peter Miller Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-williams-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of The Basketball Wives Star Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
