Tests indicated that he was overweight and had elevated muscle enzymes, specifically creatine kinase (CK), which can indicate muscle breakdown or stress.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tom-segura-weight-loss.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Tom Segura. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seguratom</a>/Instagram)</p><p>Reflecting on his past, Segura admitted that he weighed 255 pounds, contrary to the 245 pounds he mentioned in the special.&nbsp;</p><p>The 44-year-old comedian said, “I was 255 pounds. In the special, I say I was 245 pounds, but I’m lying,” via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">M&F</a>.</p><p>He had allowed bad lifestyle habits to take over, trying to convince himself that his physical health was acceptable when, deep down, he knew it wasn’t.</p><p>At the age of 34, Segura found himself completely sedentary and facing various health issues. Thankfully, he decided to make a change.&nbsp;</p><p>The comedian started incorporating workouts into his routine, and audiences could visibly see a transformation in his appearance when comparing his 2016 special,&nbsp;Mostly Stories.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it was during his 2018 special,&nbsp;Disgraceful, that the audience truly took notice of his remarkable weight loss. On stage, Segura proudly announced that he had shed 50 pounds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Segura won’t tour without his trainer these days</h2><p>In the 2023 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ</a>, Segura revealed that he asked the help of his trusted trainer and professional photographer, Shaun Nix, to accompany him on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does Nix provide fitness guidance, but he also captures moments from Segura’s tour as his official photographer.</p><p>Segura and Nix share similar characteristics, including age and build, which further enhance their working relationship.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He mentioned their dietary preferences, such as yogurt with mixed berries, omelets with tomatoes and mushrooms, and occasionally incorporating protein shakes or meal bars into their routines.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Segura realized a significant change in his eating habits during this tour. Despite not consciously aiming for a specific weight, he noticed that he weighed the lowest he had in nearly two decades.&nbsp;</p><p>He observed that his portions naturally decreased, and he no longer experienced constant hunger. This revelation made him realize how much he had been overeating in the past.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Segura’s workout plans while touring</h2><p>Tom Segura maintains a strict workout routine while on the road, as he revealed in an interview with GQ. He and his trainer, Nix, prioritize daily workouts during their tour schedule.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The workouts vary depending on the available facilities at the venues they visit. Segura mentioned that they lift weights around four or five times a week. Moreover, he said they don’t lift; they try to do heavier cardio.</p><p>They focus on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and inclines when they have access to a well-equipped gym with barbells.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-small-font-size><strong>Follow Glamour Buff on <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMOzhrgsw-ezGAw?ceid=US:en&oc=3" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News</a>!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9OopGarlZzCs62MsJyin5ipeq270qxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-wwe-alberto-del-rio-violence.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWE star Paige claims ex Alberto Del Rio physically abused her daily for hours but ex-champ says she</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-astins-wife-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Astins Wife: Who is Sean Astin Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
