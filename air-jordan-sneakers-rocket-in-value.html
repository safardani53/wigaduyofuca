How much are they worth?</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Well, according to sports memorabilia expert Aaron Rothschild, you could be sitting on a small fortune, especially with a new film starring Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Matt Damon about Nike's pursuit of Jordan is due out next month.</p><p>Interest is certain to spike once again - and Rothschild has told The U.S. Sun that could be great news for those of you with a precious pair of sneakers laying around.</p><p>Obviously the condition is key, as is which model they are. The older, the better.</p><p>"The new thing might be that we're transcending memorabilia and moving into fine art," said the Florida based expert who is eyeing a cool $4.5 million for some Jordan jerseys he's attempting to sell alongside the player sample Air Jordan 1 sneakers from the debut 1985 campaign.</p><p>"It's really interesting, with a certain class of items only. And those include things like Michael Jordan game worn sneakers.</p><p>"I have one pair of the Michael Jordan player sample, one of dozens of pairs of the exact sneakers which the new movie is about.</p><p>“This is the type of item that Sotheby's are selling, and now they are making a movie about it. This pair of sneakers is a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>"The owner wants me to sell them privately. I think after the movie comes out, the sneakers are probably going to be worth in excess of $200,000. Very similar pair, not quite as good condition sold recently for $170,000."</p><p>In October 2021, Sotheby’s sold the earliest pair of Nike kicks Jordan wore in 1984 for $1.47 million and only last year one of his jerseys went for an astonishing $10.1 million.</p><p>Apparel belonging to NBA titans Jordan, the late <a href=#>Kobe Bryant </a>and <a href=#>LeBron James</a> remain the hottest properties in town.</p><p>But what about the new generation? Who are the next superstars to start bringing in millions for sneakers and shirts?</p><p><a href=#>Tom Brady</a> will surely enter the conversation now his retirement for a second time has been confirmed although experts are skeptical when it comes to picking the next players to really strike it hot.</p><p>"It's headed to this new stratosphere," confirmed Rothschild, a 30 year industry veteran who owns <a href=#>Dutch Auctions</a>.</p><p>"If you were looking from a collective standpoint, you are entering a the new stratosphere where items are worth millions and millions.</p><p>"But it's generational, we don't know who's going be the most popular player moving forward. Jordan's market is established.</p><p>"Who is going to follow? Steph Curry? He has all the same accomplishments as LeBron but nobody's sold one of his jerseys for millions of dollars.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/1985-nike-air-jordan-1s-581790723.jpg><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIJ1fZdrZ2iZmad6q7vRnZinZaOjsqK3xKuqZqqfmLimwIyipWaukaHCpns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./savannah-duffiney-7kjr-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Savannah Duffiney (TikTok Star) - , , , , , ,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-franco-accusers-open-up-hes-not-as-bad-as-harvey-weinstein.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>He's Not as Bad as Harvey Weinstein</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
