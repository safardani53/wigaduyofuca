Viewers will be able to experience anything from underwater sound spas in the Maldives to a winter treehouse retreat in Finland thanks to Levy’s incredible exploits in the new program.</p><p>According to the official summary of The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy on the Apple TV+ website:</p><p>“The eight-part series follows Eugene Levy as he travels to some of the world’s most beautiful and intriguing destinations, including Costa Rica, Finland, Italy, Japan, the Maldives, Portugal, South Africa, and the United States, to explore remarkable hotels and the places and cultures that surround them.”</p><h2>The Reluctant Traveler will follow host Eugene Levy as he ventures outside of his comfort zone and travels the globe.</h2><p>Eugene Levy, the presenter and executive producer of Apple TV+’s fresh new series The Reluctant Traveler, will explore some of the world’s most distinctive hotels and investigate the residents, places, and cultures around them.&nbsp;Eugene Levy, self-admittedly not your usual travel show presenter, isn’t frequently bold or well-versed in foreign travel and has decided the time has come for him to broaden his horizons.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Reluctant-Traveler-1.jpg alt="The Reluctant Traveler" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As long as he doesn’t have to deal with his motion sickness and can still have dinner at seven o’clock, Levy will pack his luggage with trepidation, hoping that his experiences may open up a whole new chapter in his life.&nbsp;In an exclusive interview with PEOPLE, the Schitt’s Creek actor stated that his journey to Kruger National Park in South Africa, especially the safari ride in the new season, was “undoubtedly the most powerful,” despite his initial reluctance to attend.</p><p>“That never truly tickled me since I recognize all of the creatures. Seeing them up close won’t be all that interesting for me. Yet I discovered the risk that many of these creatures face every day from poachers and hunters. That definitely struck a chord with me.”</p><p>Levy went on to say that although he was aware of the poaching crisis in South Africa, it wasn’t until he saw the animals that it struck home.</p><p></p><p>As shown in the clip, Levy encounters a volcano, travels in a helicopter, and even goes ice fishing in the Arctic Circle. He also finds himself traveling through the desert on horseback. Levy had to deal with a sick elephant in one unforgettable sequence, informing the camera that he’s never stuck his fingers up an elephant’s bottom before.</p><p>Eugene Levy has been a professional actor for almost five decades. Fans may recognize him as Jim’s father in the popular American Pie series. He is most recognized for his depiction as Johnny Rose with Catherine O’Hara as Moira Rose in the smash Netflix comedy series, Schitt’s Creek, co-authored by his son, Dan Levy. Eugene has also appeared in Splash, National Lampoon’s Vacation, Father of the Bride II, Armed and Dangerous, The Man, A Mighty Wind, and a number of other films.</p><h2>The Reluctant Traveler, starring Eugene Levy, will launch on Apple TV+ on Friday.</h2><p>The 76-year-old actor decides to reconnect with nature and learn what it’s like to be really cold by traveling to the Arctic Circle and the frozen wilderness of Lapland in the first episode of the eight-part docuseries The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy season 1. In the episode, Eugene says:</p><p>“This is about as severe as it gets for a person who doesn’t appreciate extremes. One for armchair travelers.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Reluctant-Traveler-2.jpg alt="The Reluctant Traveler" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>While Eugene visits eight different countries in The Reluctant Traveler, the show’s trailer reveals that the actor does not consider travel to be one of his favorite pleasures, preferring instead “the vast interiors.”&nbsp;Sarah Levy, his daughter, and Schitt’s Creek co-star, and his wife, Deborah Divine, accompany him on several of his excursions in the series.&nbsp;The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy, created by Twofour for Apple TV+ and executive produced by Levy and David Brindley, will debut on Apple TV+ on Friday, February 24, 2023. The program will most likely broadcast at 3 a.m. ET.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Apple TV+</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>The Reluctant Traveler</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KtwcKtmKesXam%2FosLEpZyrZZFiv6aty6KrsmWUpLC2ucSnq5qqqWLApr7InqpmoaNiwKbAjK2mZqqVobKiv8SdZKimXZa9sbjEZquvZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./police-allege-north-carolina-woman-seeking-revenge-ex-set-fire-wrong-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Woman Allegedly Set Fire to Home She Thought Belonged to Her Ex</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./priscilla-renea-19880914-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Priscilla Renea (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
