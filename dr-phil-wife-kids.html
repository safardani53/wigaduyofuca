Since then, he’s been the star of his own show, Dr. Phil, which has, in turn, led to a number of successful spin-offs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, <a href=#>the “doctor”</a> is appearing on a new show called House Calls With Dr. Phil, in which he visits a different family in each episode and helps them work through a household problem. But while Dr. Phil is slated to appear in the homes of Americans across the country, what do we know about his own home life? Who is Dr. Phil’s wife and does he have any kids?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Dr. Phil have a wife?</h2><p>People go on Dr. Phil’s show to deal with some of their more complicated and deep-seated issues but luckily, the host himself has little to worry about in the relationship department. The TV personality and author has been married to his current wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin McGraw</a>, since 1976 and they are still going strong today.</p><p>Recounting the story of how they met to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo! Lifestyle</a>, Robin said that Dr. Phil was visiting his parents' home in Oklahoma when they first met. "I was friends with his sister," Robin said. "So I walk into the room, there he is. He looks up and the first thing he says was, ‘Who are you?'”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The couple told Yahoo! that neither of them was actively looking for a relationship, but that Robin knew she was in love with Phil on their very first date: her very first airplane ride, with Phil as the pilot. “I really go with my gut always. I knew I’d be safe with this man,” she said. “I do believe in love at first sight, and I fell in love with this man on that very first night.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Three years after they met, Phil proposed, and the couple got married at a Baptist church in Wichita Falls, Tex. Unlike many other celebrity couples who haven’t managed to sustain a relationship while in the public eye, Phil and Robin had a couple of years to lay down a strong foundation before Phil became a household name.</p><p>“We have always focused on each other. We’ve always made it a point to put each other first,” Robin explained. “So it’s just this comfort and this love of our life together that we have, and we never forget that.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do Dr. Phil and Robin have kids?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Phil and Robin’s youngest son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan McGraw</a>, was born in 1986 and is an aspiring musician. His latest single, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"SHE,"</a> came out in July 2021, following on the heels of his previous song, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"HER,"</a> which came out in April 2021. The music video for "SHE" also stars Jordan’s new wife, E! News personality <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Stewart</a>.
