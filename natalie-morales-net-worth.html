I loved the audience interaction and how involved they are with the hosts. It's funny because from the minute I walked out here, it was like I felt like I'm at home."</p><p>She actually noted that her decision to join CBS was years in the making, only held back by the circumstances that befell the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>"I guess it was like going back two years before the [COVID-19] pandemic," she said. "This was a possibility and I had said to my agent at the time, 'I really would love to see if I could find a way to come to The Talk, also do some CBS News and work with them in that way.' At that time, there was a full cast here, there wasn't a lot of room for movement yet. Then, of course, things change."</p><p>And change they have. Fans can catch Natalie on CBS's The Talk airing weekdays at 2 p.m. EST.</p><p>She's also recently been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hired as a correspondent for CBS News</a>.
