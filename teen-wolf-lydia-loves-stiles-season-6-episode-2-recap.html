Scott can feel them, but he just can’t see them. He’s out on the field with Liam, telling him that he needs to work on his backshot. The thing is, Liam’s backshot is razor sharp. “I must be thinking of someone else,” a confused Scott says. Yeah, STILES!</p><p>[interaction id=”5835229a10941d3913476a1a”]</p><h3><a href=#>Watch ‘Teen Wolf’ Without&nbsp;Cable</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Mason’s sticking around at school with Corey for physics extra credit. He doesn’t need it because of his 4.9 GPA. Mason is so adorable. He stays to be near Corey. Coach (!) runs into the classroom and demands they leave. He tells them to go find some girls (or boys) and stir up some trouble. God, I love him.</p><h3>See More Pics Of ‘Teen Wolf’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Mason forgets his phone and goes back in the school to get it. Suddenly, Corey feels the Ghost Riders enter the school. They stare right at him, but he’s invisible. He texts Mason to tell him to stay away. Mason walks into the library and sees his classmate choking to death in midair. With Corey’s help, Mason can see that the Ghost Rider is killing the kid. When it looks like the kid’s head is going to be torn right off, he completely disappears.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Liam can sense something’s happening to Mason, and he runs back to the school with Scott. Mason and Corey explain what they just saw. Since the Ghost Riders obliterated that kid, no one even remembers he existed. So their story doesn’t make sense.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Malia is spending quality time getting BONED by a good-looking stranger. She’s pretty much indifferent to the guy afterwards. He gets a little spooked when he sees chains in her bag. Dude, don’t judge.</p><h3>Try To Remember</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lydia is scared nearly to death when she feels as if a train is passing through her room. There’s screeching wheels, bright lights, the whole works. The thing is, it isn’t a bad dream. She is awake. In class, she sees a random doctor and feels the train again. Lydia begins hallucinating her final moment with Stiles, but he’s not there. She can hear his voice and feel him pulling her to his car. Malia saves her from nearly becoming roadkill. When Malia asks Lydia what she was doing, Lydia says, “Trying to remember.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Corey can’t get the Ghost Riders out of his head. He has a feeling the Ghost Riders were holding someone in the library. Mason agrees that something isn’t right.&nbsp;Corey and Mason go to Parrish, but he shuts them out. He’s trying to take it easy after all that drama last season. Meanwhile, Liam is not a fan of Mason spending all this time with Corey. Liam doesn’t trust Corey at all. He may be a little jealous that he’s not spending as much time with Mason as he’d like. He doesn’t want Mason to have to choose between him and Corey.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Later, Corey and Liam call a truce. They work together to figure out the reason why the Ghost Riders were in the school. While Corey and Liam are invisible, they spot a library card. When Liam’s not invisible, he can’t see it. When Corey grabs the card, it appears. Because Mason is a genius, he explains what’s going down. The card wasn’t real until Corey saw it. To see something changes its reality. When Liam swipes the card, Mason Sullivan’s name pops up.</p><h3>Get Back Up</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>Scott is trying to give Liam more of a leadership role on the lacrosse team since Scott is graduating soon. Someone has to step up and fill the gap when Scott leaves, and he believes that person should be Liam. The whole hero role has never come easily to Liam. Scott gives Liam the pep talk he needs, telling him not to run in the face of fear. “You&nbsp;have to show them you can get back up,” Scott says. And he’s not just talking about lacrosse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The pack slowly begins to realize that someone is missing in their lives. As Malia is highlighting in a textbook, she hovers over the world “style.” Scott has a feeling that something is missing in the picture of him, Lydia, and Malia. He just can’t put his finger on it. Scott also notices Stiles’ locker. When he tries to open it, the creepy (but hot) new teacher stops him.</p><h3>‘I Think I Loved Him’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Tyler goes to Deaton for help. There’s a gaping hole in his life. Something’s not there anymore, but it used to be. He thinks the holes in his life, the Wild Hunt, and the Ghost Riders are all connected. Deaton believes that Tyler’s subconscious is trying to tell him what he’s missing. Deaton urges Scott to go to sleep. When he does, he wakes up in the middle of the woods.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Lydia finds Malia as she tries to chain herself up when she was about to get out of hand. Someone used to help her, and she couldn’t have done it alone. The girls get a call from Scott. He recalls the the night he was bitten. He knows he wasn’t in the woods by himself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“I think I had a best friend,” he says. “And I think he was out here with me that night.” YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THAT, TYLER!</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I came to school this morning and I was sure I was supposed to meet someone,” Lydia says. “But I couldn’t remember who it was supposed to be. I have been looking for them all day. Whoever it is, I think I loved him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lydia loves Stiles !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>She said it! I can officially die a happy woman! STYDIA FOREVER!</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>They all realize they’re missing the same person. Come on, you guys! You’re so close! Malia and Scott take Lydia to Deaton. He&nbsp;wants her to let go of all thought in this automatic writing exercise. She looks at the piece of glass the Ghost Riders shot at in the premiere. She scribbles down the word “mischief” all over a piece of paper. The words form “STILES” on the page!</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>*Okay, so I watched the screener at the airport as my flight continually got delayed. I totally missed on the first watch of Stiles’ mom being alive in this reality! Does this confirm she died giving birth to Stiles?!</p><p id=content-paragraph-20><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of tonight’s Teen Wolf? Let me know!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye5FrZq2dlaN6uLvLn2SlsZSerm64zq%2BcrGWjqbatsdJmqp6Zo6S7boKMnqeiq5%2BZsm5%2BjKucnJmgZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./parasite-actor-lee-sun-kyun-dead-at-age-48-after-apparent-suicide.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Parasite Actor Lee Sun-kyun Dead At Age 48 After Apparent Suicide</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leonardo-dicaprio-decorated-his-home-with-titanic-items.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leonardo DiCaprio Decorated His Home With Titanic Items</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
