Here’s all you need to know about her family and financial worth. Mitra Kassai is a well-known figure in Hamburg’s musical and cultural environment. She has also previously managed hip-hop luminaries such as 5 Sterne Deluxe.</p><p>Mitra presently serves on the board of Rock City e.V., an organization dedicated to fostering young musicians, and is a member of the Millerntor Gallery’s advisory board. Kassai has also been hosting “seniors and seniority” events as the creator of the non-profit organization Oll Inklusiv since 2017. Similarly, she organizes activities ranging from club nights and street art tours to music bingo and graffiti classes. Mitra is also highly followed on social media platforms, particularly Instagram, where she has thousands of followers.</p><h2>Mitra Kassai’s Wiki And Bio</h2><p>As Hamburg’s music and culture environment has yet to assume her position on Wikipedia’s official page, several issues have been raised concerning Mitra Kassai’s Wikipedia profile. Mitra is well-known for her professional career, which she has been in from the beginning. Although her biography is not yet on Wikipedia, it has been noted on other websites.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mitra-Kassai-1.jpg alt="Mitra Kassai" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to one source, Mitra Kassai is a doer with heart, compassion, and charm. Similarly, she is a woman with several identities: she is a hatter, a cultural manager, a DJ, and a volunteer. Furthermore, Kassai has been working with Viva con Aqua, a global campaign for clean drinking water, since 2007.</p><p>Mitra also serves on the advisory board of the Millerntor Gallery and supports the Hamburg Musicians’ Association Rock City. Similarly, the City of Hamburg bestowed the Annemarie Dose Prize to Mitra in 2019 for her social and creative efforts with “Oll Inklusiv.” In one of the interviews, she revealed that she used the prize money to pursue her education to become a senior citizen’s helper.</p><h2>Meet The Oll Inklusiv Founder&nbsp;Mitra Kassai&nbsp;Family</h2><p><strong>Mitra Kassai’s</strong> transformation has piqued the interest of fans, who have questioned her age and birth facts. However, the full extent of her age is now unavailable in the media.&nbsp;Similarly, none of the media outlets have updated the information on Kassai’s birth and early life, therefore her age remains one of the most often asked issues. Kassai has also seldom disclosed her personal data freely on media outlets, hence her personal details remain unknown for the time being.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mitra-Kassai-2.jpg alt="Mitra Kassai" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Similarly, she has not disclosed any information about her parents or siblings. As a result, the family data of Oll Inklusiv’s founder have yet to be updated.&nbsp;Well-wishers will have to wait longer to learn more about her family and personal life since she keeps a low-key profile when it comes to her personal matters.</p><h2>Mitra Kassai’s Net Worth</h2><p>Mitra Kassai’s net worth must be in the millions. Furthermore, the precise value of Kassai’s net worth has yet to be updated on web sources.&nbsp;Kassai has achieved both fame and fortune as a result of her professional career. Kassai must have made a lot of money from the music and cultural environment. Mitra’s major motivation is to bring good humor and be there in both individual and group care, which includes making phone calls, assisting with shopping, and whatever else they may want.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikoqyilnqsrdKsmKJlp564qnnWoZyrnV2ZvKa%2FjKyfnmWfp7aotc2aq55llqe8rnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5wKebZp6RoratxYyer6mkn6eycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-neal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Neal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dwayne-johnson-is-grateful-for-wife-lauren-hashian-after-covid-19.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dwayne Johnson Is Grateful for Wife Lauren Hashian After COVID-19</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
