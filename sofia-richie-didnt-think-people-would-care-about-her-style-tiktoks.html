Now, her page — which has 3.4 million followers — features makeup videos, <a href=#>hair tutorials</a>, styling tips and more. “I didn’t think anyone would care,” Richie said, gushing that she now loves experimenting with other social media users’ beauty tips.</p><p>“People have so many fun hacks that I had no idea about,” she praised, noting that she was not a fan of using concealer as lipstick. “Being honest, it is something that I will never do again.”</p><p>Before <a href=#>sharing her style</a> — which consists of tweed dresses, fluted jackets, glossy pumps and several Hermès handbags — on social media, Sofia leaned on sister<strong> Nicole Richie</strong> for help creating her style reputation.</p><p>“When you’re young, you rebel … I got to an age – I’m going to say around 20 years old – where I was like, ‘OK, this is a reputation I’m going to have [for a long time],” Sofia explained. (Nicole — who used to star on reality shows including The Simple Life, Candidly Nicole and more — has a clothing line of her own, House Of Harlow 1960.)</p><p>“There were steps that I felt I had to take,” Richie continued, sharing that Nicole, 42, advised her to “figure out your personal style so that when people think of you, there’s a clear vision of how you dress, how you feel, a vibe you give off.”</p><p>Soon, fans will be able to channel their inner Sofia when she releases her clothing line, SRG.</p><p>“My true focus is designing, and 2024 is the beginning of me really building onto that SRG brand,” Sofia shared. Although she’s been fairly tight-lipped about <a href=#>what her brand will offer</a>, she noted that SRG will feature fashion and beauty, as well as interiors. “I haven’t really shown people my home, so I’m excited to open that door,” she gushed.</p><p>Richie previously <a href=#>teased a garment</a> that “may or may not” be featured in her brand in September via Instagram.</p><p>She posed in a dress featuring a black long sleeve knit top finished with a mock neck, as well as a silky pleated maxi skirt. She moved the fabric around, to give fans a peek at how flowy — and somewhat sheer — it was.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This may or may not be coming spring – SRG,” she captioned the video.</p><p>Richie has not yet shared when her brand will be released.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i8p7XAZqmim5iesm6wyJ2lrWWknbavt4ypnKionJp6uLvUpZtmm5Gnsm6twaisrWWYmr9uv9Oyo55lpJ64tbvKrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-norton-in-the-crown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Norton Knatchbull in Netflix's 'The Crown' Season 5?
