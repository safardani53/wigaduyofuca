They can look very stylish, too!</p><p>We've rounded up some of the best tower fans you can buy in 2023 with different features and price points.</p><h2>Best tower fans at a glance:</h2><h2>We tested: <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Levoit Tower Fan</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/CYlcSy9uyE8nI2UevkSEQgW2maszWPrJ6yKMRvZy-VNMmgNTW4QLYvMcFHd2LMGRq_kM8N6fv3OB0aPkqQlnrSPc9KWwHJR3hyvpb3XqwaNI89dfZSHNk0VjlKI7mg=s0-d-e1-ft#dmscdn.vuelio.co.uk/publicitem/05fc8dbc-565c-4a4c-91ce-0482d29c2d67"><ul><li><strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Levoit Tower Fan, £89.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>The Levoit Tower Fan quite simply got us through this summer's first heatwave. It is super powerful with four modes and five fan speeds (it can reach up to 25 feet per seconds), and we found that it actually did make the room overall feel much cooler rather than just blowing lukewarm air around. This was especially true when we had the fan on the 90 degree oscillation mode, since it provided a wider coverage and circulated fresh air to every corner in the room.</p><p>The fan is really quiet, too. It has noise levels as low as 28 dB which the brand describes as 'whisper quiet', and we'd agree. If you struggle to sleep with noise or light distractions, stick it in Advanced Sleep Mode. On this setting, the display lights are turned off and the fan speed is adjusted based on your stages of sleep. Genius, right?&nbsp; Oh, and the fan can be controlled by a remote control so you don't have to move from your bed, desk or sofa of you really don't want to.</p><h2>We tested: <strong>Dimplex DXMBCF Black Tower Fan</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fan4.png><ul><li><strong>Dimplex DXMBCF Black Tower Fan, £85.00 from Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This Dimplex Black Tower Fan is a bargain cooling companion that has three speed settings and a remote control.</p><p>This tower fan's on the cheaper end of the cooling-tech spectrum, but it boasts amazing reviews, so we were excited to try it out.</p><p>When it first arrived, we found it a bit fiddly having to screw the base onto the fan, but our criticism stopped there.</p><p>It's so quiet in comparison to other tower fans we've used, ideal for using as you sleep on ridiculously hot days (we're British so anything above 20 is boiling).</p><p>You can set it to moving or stationary mode and there are different power settings too, all of which can be altered via the remote control or directly on the fan.</p><p>Although it's plastic, the black design looks quite modern and stylish, so we definitely recommend this for our bargain-hunters out there.</p><p><strong>Key specs</strong> - <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.14kg, <strong>Dimensions:</strong> ‎31.3 x 31.3 x 120.9cm, <strong>Power:</strong> 40 watts, <strong>Speeds: </strong>3, <strong>Guarantee: </strong>One year.</p><h2>Best Dyson tower fan: Dyson AM07 Cooling Tower Fan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/300910-01.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Dyson AM07, £349 from John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>For maximum style points, it's hard to look past the Dyson AM07.

And as a bonus, the fan uses 10% less energy than the AM02, the model it replaces and is 60% quieter.</p><p>A really neat feature is that the remote control has a magnetic element to it which means it attaches to the top of the purifier — handy if you are always losing remotes.</p><p><strong>Key specs</strong> - <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.9kg, <strong>Dimensions: </strong>H100.7 x W19 x D11cm, <strong>Power: </strong>56 watts, <strong>Speeds: </strong>10, <strong>Cord length:</strong> 2m,&nbsp;<strong>Guarantee:</strong> two years.</p><h4>READ MORE:</h4><h2>Best tower fan with remote control: Ansio Tower Fan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2021-05-04-at-09.36.37.png><ul><li><strong>Ansio Tower fan, £64.97 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This 30-inch tower fan by Ansio is perfect for those that may have a larger room.<br>It has three speed settings as well as three wind mode settings: normal, nature, and taper.</p><p>It comes with a remote control that makes it super easy to change the setting at the click of a button.</p><p>There is also a timer function, meaning the tower fan can be set to turn off after some time while the integrated handle makes it effortless to transport from place to place.</p><p>Plus, it's tall and sleek-looking, so it'll fit seamlessly into most rooms with ease and you won't have to worry about it ruining your carefully planned aesthetic.</p><p><strong>Key stats</strong> - <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.86kg, <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 24 x 24 x 76.5cm, <strong>Power:</strong> 45 watts, <strong>Speeds:</strong> 3, <strong>Cord length:</strong> 2m.</p><h2>Best tower fan for the bedroom: Silentnight <span class=base data-ui-id=page-title-wrapper>Oscillating Bladeless </span>Tower Fan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2021-05-04-at-10.38.37.png><ul><li><strong><strong>Silentnight Oscillating Bladeless </strong></strong><strong>Tower Fan, £86.99 from Robert Dyas - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Get the perfect night's sleep with this&nbsp;futuristic-looking tower fan by Silentnight.</p><p>It is bladeless and oscillates at 60°, plus its three fan modes and three speeds mean it can keep even bigger bedrooms at the optimum temperature for a happy slumber.</p><p>It has an attractive slimlin design too, so it won't take up too much time or throw off a modern or minimalistic looking home.</p><p>Silentnight is known for its good quality products and this item has some easy-to-use functions including a built-in standby timer mode, remote control, and three different fan modes.</p><p>The timer on this one can be set from half an hour to 7 and a half hours, so you won't have to worry about wasting energy overnight as you sleep.</p><p><strong>Key stats</strong> - <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.9kg, ‎<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 28.5 x 27.8 x 110.8cm,<strong> Power:</strong> 40 watts, <strong>Speeds:</strong> 3, <strong>Cord length:</strong> 1.5m.</p><h2>Best bladeless tower fan: ElectriQ <span class=title>Bladeless Quiet Tower Fan with Mood Light</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/electriQ-eiQ-AM07.jpg><ul><li><strong>ElectriQ <span class=title>Bladeless Quiet Tower Fan with Mood Light</span></strong> <strong>eiQ-AM07, £179.98 from Appliances Direct - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you like the idea of a bladeless tower fan but you don't want to splash out on a Dyson, take a look at this electriQ tower fan.</p><p>It's got a similar sleek design at a slightly lower price and it's loved by customers.

You want to think about what you use the fan for (to cool the whole room or to cool your face while you work at your desk) and how much you can afford.</p><p>When you set a budget, you can look at the tower fans below that price and get the one that ticks your most important requirements without too much compromising.</p><p>For example, if you want a quiet tower fan for sleeping at night at an affordable price that you can easily buy online, the<a href=#> John Lewis tower fan</a> is a great option.</p><h2>Where to buy a tower fan in the UK?</h2><p>You can buy a tower fan from most home and garden retailers, supermarkets and DIY stores. But, you better get in early. These handy pieces of tech are hard to come by when the heatwave hits, so it's good to buy yours ahead of time. Try the following retailers:</p><ul><li>Currys</li><li>Boots</li><li>Amazon</li><li>Homebase</li><li>Sonic Direct</li><li>Breathing Space</li><li>Argos</li><li>Dyson</li><li>Dunelm</li><li>Robert Dyas</li><li>B&Q</li><li>Wilko</li><li>Aldi</li><li>ASDA</li><li>John Lewis</li></ul><h2>How much do tower fans cost?</h2><p>Like anything, the cost of tower fans varies from brand to brand. If you want to go top of the range and buy a Dyson, you're looking at spending around £350. However, you could find an effective tower fan for around £30 if you're on a budget.</p><h2>How much electricity does a tower fan use?</h2><p>How much electricity a fan uses depends on its wattage, how long you use it for, and the cost of electricity. On average though, a tower fan uses very little energy to run and will cost around 40p a day if it's on for 20 hours. That's around £12 a month.</p><h2>Are tower fans easy to use?</h2><p>Yes, they are! They usually require minimal assembly. They often have speed settings that can be adjusted to suit your needs depending on the temperature of the day and your room. Many designs come with a remote control that makes it even easier to operate.</p><h2>Are tower fans better than regular fans?</h2><p>A tower fan can be more useful than a pedestal fan if you're planning on using it regularly as it will fit into a corner of a room without taking up much space and with a small footprint.</p><p>The bladeless designs also tend to be quieter than pedestal fans which makes them useful if you're planning on having them turned on while you sleep.</p><p>Tower fans will likely provide more powerful cooling than your average desk fan. Plus, their tall, sleek design makes them a great accessory for any room, especially in a modern home.</p><h2>Do tower fans cool a room?</h2><p>Most tower fans will circulate air in a room which will have a cooling effect without actually lowering the air temperature.</p><p>Some fans, such as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dyson Pure</a>, will also remove allergens from the air. They're different from air conditioners — you don't have to close the door when the tower fan is on.</p><h2>How to clean a tower fan</h2><p>It's best to refer to the individual fan's user instructions but in general, you can remove dust and debris from a tower fan's blades using a can of compressed air.</p><p>You can also use the brush attachment from a vacuum cleaner and wipe down the exterior of your tower fan with a damp cloth.</p><h2>Do tower fans have blades?</h2><p>Tower fans do have blades but they're concealed within the fan's outer casing and aren't visible.</p><p>Even the 'blade-less' Dyson fan has blades hidden in the stand as this is how the rapid airflow is created.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmppZm2Dd3%2BYaJmeq6RiwbDDxKtkn5meqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-miscarriage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonc on Her Miscarriages New 'Elle' Tell-All Interview</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bandhunta-izzy-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bandhunta Izzy Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
