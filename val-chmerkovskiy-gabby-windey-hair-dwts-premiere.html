Because of that transition of responsibilities, it can be stressful. I make it very clear, I’m going to be challenging at times, and I really, I really in advance, want to thank you for your patience with me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/val-chmerkovskiy-and-gabby-windey-in-DWTS-disney-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Val continued, “At the end of the day, regardless of what hat I wear, we are two people who are pretty much peers, about the same age and the respect that is in that room is mutual, regardless of my position as her coach or partner or whatever else.” The pro added that he has “immense respect” for the former&nbsp;Bachelorette star, noting the “courage” it took to be on<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars</a> in the first place. “I’m her safe space in all of this, as well. I’m her liaison and guide to this world and I take that role very seriously,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The pair are coming off a fabulous first performance ahead of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a two-night event on&nbsp;Dancing With The Stars&nbsp;</a>this week. Val and Gabby received straights nines from the judges for their stunning Foxtrot to “If the World Should Ever Stop” by JP Cooper. “We accelerated really quickly this week, so I think it will be our most challenging yet,” Val said to HL ahead of the performances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/val-chmerkovskiy-and-gabby-windey-in-DWTS-disney-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The father-to-be went on</a> to recall a moment before his first performance with Gabby in the&nbsp;DWTS season 23 premiere, when he ended up doing her hair! “One of the things that I think people at home don’t realize is that we are also partially their creative directors. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I make sure her outfits fit,</a> I’m at all of her fittings, things like that people don’t realize,” Val revealed. “I think our hair and makeup teams are so incredible, but the first episode, things were super busy and some things got away, and I ended up doing Gabby’s final hair for her. I got her into the trailer and I gelled it the way I wanted it, and put it in a bun, and we went on.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Val explained that growing up in the professional dancing world prepared him for the big stage, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>high-pressure arena that is </a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DWTS</a>.&nbsp;“We booked our flights, we checked in hotels, we rhinestoned our own shirts, dresses and shoes. I grew up with it not being taboo or weird to be a teammate with a female. We lost together, we won together, we’d eat ramen together overseas, not being able to afford anything else,” he reminisced. “Those are the things that I now take with me to the show. My approach on the show is the same way regardless of the competition. I went from the lobbies in Connecticut to the biggest stage in the world. It doesn’t matter. My approach is the same.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/val-chmerkovskiy-and-gabby-windey-in-DWTS-disney-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tune in to&nbsp;Dancing With The Stars&nbsp;for a special second episode Dance Marathon, tonight, at 8 PM ET on Disney+ and see Val Chmerkovskiy and Gabby Windey crush it in the ballroom once again!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BxZq%2BZnGKwqbnEq6KorqOgtrp5xpqZm7FdrLavsMSyZKGZmad6pcPTrGSpqpWitqa%2BxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leomie-andersons-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Leomie Anderson Dating Leomie Anderson's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kristoff-st-john-pic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kristoff St. John Pic - The Hollywood Gossip</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
