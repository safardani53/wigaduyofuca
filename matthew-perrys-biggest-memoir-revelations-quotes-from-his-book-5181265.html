At the time, the late American-Canadian actor was promoting his memoir, <i>Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing,</i> which explores his past relationships, family life and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>substance abuse</a>.</p><h2>Matthew Had a ‘2 Percent Chance to Live’ After OxyContin Abuse</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>While promoting his book, Matthew revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>PEOPLE</i></a> the shocking statement the hospital told his family when he ruptured his colon after using OxyContin in 2019. “The doctors told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my family</a> that I had a two percent chance to live,” he explained. “That’s the time I really came close to my life ending.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In his book, the former <i>Odd Couple </i>actor rehashed his diagnosis and the subsequent seven-hour surgery. His experience resulted in a coma that lasted two weeks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I will have to live out the rest of my days knowing that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my mother</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>others</a> heard those words,” Matthew wrote, referring to when the doctors believed he wouldn’t survive. “I had realized that my greatest fear had come true, which is that I did this to myself.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As a result of his drug abuse, Matthew revealed he had been “in a mental institution, gone to therapy twice a week for thirty years” and had “been to death’s door.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Why He Almost Didn’t Play Chandler on ‘Friends’<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>When casting calls were sent out for <i>Friends</i> — initially titled <i>Friends Like Us</i> — Matthew nearly didn’t audition due to his contract with the show <i>L.A.X 2194</i>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I was devastated. When I read the script for<i> Friends Like Us</i>, it was as if someone had followed me around for a year,” the Massachusetts native explained, before adding, “I was Chandler.” Once<i> L.A.X 2194</i> wasn’t picked up for a season, Matthew landed his role as Chandler.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matthew-perry-friends-cast.jpg alt="Matthew LeBlanc, Courteney Cox, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer" width=620 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>His Substance Abuse on the Set of Films and Shows</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Matthew described how he worked on his 2002 film, <i>Serving Sara</i>, while taking drugs and drinking vodka.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“Every day, I would show up to set, pass out in my chair, wake up to do a scene, stumble to set, then just basically scream into a camera for two minutes,” Matthew wrote. “I needed to make real amends … so, I recorded my slurred parts for the entire movie, which meant I looped the entire movie. Then, I committed to doing the most press possible in the history of press, bending over backward to make things right.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>After he was cast in <i>Friends</i>, Matthew struggled to stay sober during his 10 years on the show. In his book, the <i>17 Again</i> actor revealed that the only time he was sober was when he shot season 9 of the comedy series. During season 7, Matthew’s character, Chandler, marries Monica (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Courteney Cox</b></a>). In Matthew’s memoir, he remembered going to rehab while working on those scenes.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I married Monica and got driven back to the treatment center — at the height of my highest point in <i>Friends</i>, the highest point in my career, the iconic moment on the iconic show — in a pickup truck helmed by a sober technician,” Matthew noted.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Why Matthew Broke Up With Julia Roberts</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Though it was a short-lived romance, Matthew had a high-profile relationship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Julia Roberts</b></a> in the 1990s. They fell in love after Matthew reached out to Julia to find out if she would appear in an episode of <i>Friends</i>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“Three or four times a day, I would sit by my fax machine and watch the piece of paper slowly revealing her next missive,” the <i>Whole Nine Yards</i> actor recalled. “It was like she was placed on this planet to make the world smile, and now, in particular, me.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Despite enjoying a sweet relationship with her, Matthew decided to call things off with the “biggest movie star in the world” because he felt that he would never be “enough” for her.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>“I was not enough; I could never be enough; I was broken, bent, unloveable,” he wrote in his memoir. “So, instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia Roberts.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Why He Didn’t Appear in ‘Don’t Look Up’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Matthew wanted to land dramatic acting roles after <i>Friends</i> came to an end. Though he initially struggled to find a successful job, he was approached by filmmaker <b>Adam McKay</b> to portray a journalist in the hit 2020 Netflix film <i>Don’t Look Up</i>. However, Matthew was in a rehab facility in Switzerland battling addiction and undergoing surgery.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>“Being in <i>Don’t Look Up</i> didn’t work out because my life was on fire, but I learned an important lesson: I was hirable in something big without putting on a show,” Matthew pointed out in one excerpt from his book.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Jennifer Aniston ‘Didn’t Want’ to be in ‘Friends’ Anymore</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Matthew claimed that while the Friends cast agreed to end the show, Jennifer was the one who already decided she “didn’t want” to do it anymore.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“The truth was, we were all ready for Friends to be done. For a start, Jennifer Aniston had decided that she didn’t want to do the show anymore, and as we all made decisions as a group, that meant we all had to stop,” he wrote. “Jennifer wanted to do movies; I had been doing movies all that time and had The Whole Ten Yards about to come out, which was sure to be a hit. … Even though it had been the greatest job in the world, the stories of Monica, Chandler, Joey, Ross, Rachel and Phoebe had all pretty much played out by 2004.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22><i>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, contact the&nbsp;</i><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</i></a><i>&nbsp;at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaq62glax6sbHRq7CsZZKetKix0q1kpp2dpLazedGerZ6kkam2sLrSZqiup6SawG6y0aikZqCZqHqju86kZG5paGZ%2Fd4GO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-evanss-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Sean Evans Dating Sean Evans's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-marley-kids-4629935.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet His 12 Children And 20 Plus Granchildren Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
