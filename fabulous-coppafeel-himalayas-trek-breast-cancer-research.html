As children we were inseparable, and even as adults we only lived two minutes apart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/L-Helen-R-Kay-.jpg><p>“When she was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in 2013, it came as a huge shock. Helen was fit and active and didn’t smoke or drink, so I always thought she’d live well into old age.</p><p>“Throughout the gruelling <a href=#>chemo</a> Helen stayed positive, even when the cancer returned in 2015.</p><p>“When she died that September, the pain was indescribable.</p><p>“She always talked about showing her daughters Alys, 15, and Isabelle, 12, that they can do anything, and I want to carry on that legacy for her. She’d be so proud of me for doing this. I know she’ll be with me every step.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190406_A_073-e1555461378755.jpg><h2>‘Checking my boobs saved my life’</h2><p><strong>Bookkeeper Jo Gray, 40, lives in Towcester with husband Rob, 40, and daughters Maisy, eight, and Tabitha, four.</strong></p><p>“In February 2017 I noticed a dimple on my left breast. I’d read <a href=#>a CoppaFeel! piece</a> that emphasised how important it is to know what’s normal for your boobs, so I went to my GP, who couldn’t find a lump but referred me for a mammogram just in case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jo.jpg><p>“Days later I received the devastating news that I had cancer, which had spread to my lymph nodes.</p><p>“The chemo and radiotherapy really took it out of me, and I would get tired quickly, but my kids only understood I was poorly.</p><p>“That August, I had a mastectomy, and during those difficult months walking became my respite. Thankfully, I was given the all-clear.</p><p>“I count myself incredibly lucky that I spotted such a small change in my boob – without CoppaFeel! I might not be here today.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190406_A_033-e1555461328344.jpg><h2>‘I’m doing this for my best friend’</h2><p><strong>Charity worker Ashley Earle, 28, lives in Nottingham with her son Tyler, eight.</strong></p><p>“Watching my best friend Alex Jones battle breast cancer for three years was both inspiring and agonising. When she was diagnosed in late 2013, aged just 23, she was so brave, enduring chemo and a <a href=#>double mastectomy</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/L-Ashely-and-R-Alex.jpg><p>“In March 2015, just over a year after her diagnosis, we were given the devastating news that the cancer had spread to her bones, and she passed away in November 2016. My heart broke knowing I’d lost her.</p><p>“Alex’s bravery inspired all her friends and family to carry on her legacy, so in 2017 her mum Chris, 60, signed up to the Fabulous Challenge to <a href=#>cross the deserts of Oman</a>, and last year her sister Phoebe, 23, completed the trek across Transylvania.</p><p>“Now it’s my turn. I’m very nervous but I can’t wait to help keep Alex’s memory alive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190406_A_112-e1555461294300.jpg><h2>‘Getting diagnosed at uni was a shock’</h2><p><strong>Data analyst Jane Robinson, 26, lives in London.</strong></p><p>“I never thought I’d have breast <a href=#>cancer at 21</a>. Studying maths at Durham University and enjoying student life, I only worried about deadlines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jane.jpg><p>“Then, checking my boobs in September 2014, I found a small lump on my left breast.

My family and boyfriend helped me stay positive, but carrying on with my studies as well as dealing with the news was tough. I took a week off uni and had a mastectomy with reconstruction, which meant I didn’t need chemo.</p><p>“Now I live with a scar and an oddly round boob, but the experience has shown me I’m stronger than I ever thought.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190406_A_020.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Giovanna Fletcher plays Fabulous Challenges Discs ahead of CoppaFeel!
