While Us Weekly confirmed in 2020 that <a href=#>the pair called it quits after two years</a> together, both the Green Bay Packer and the NASCAR star, 40, have a history of looking back fondly on their romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Danica-Patrick-and-Aaron-Rodgers.jpg><p class=x_x_p2>During a 2021 episode of Running Wild With Bear Grylls, the Pretty Intense author opened up about the breakup and the takeaways that came along with the experience.</p><p class=x_x_p1>“I learned a lot and as broken open as I was on the sad end, I have felt so much joy in so many more instances and so many more unlikely places than I ever have, so it’s like my heart got broken open to both ends of the spectrum,” the Wisconsin native said of her romance with the Super Bowl champion.</p><p class=x_x_p1>Following his split with Patrick, Rodgers moved on with <a href=#><strong>Shailene Woodley</strong></a>, whom he met sometime during the coronavirus pandemic. While rumors of their romance were sparked in July 2020, the duo <a href=#>kept their relationship under wraps</a> until they announced their engagement in February 2021.</p><p class=x_x_p1>One year after the California native popped the question, however, Us confirmed the twosome had split.</p><p class="x_x_p1 x_x_elementToProof">“Shailene has been super busy with work,” an insider told Us at the time, noting that Rodgers was always “focused” on football. “Everything <a href=#>was so different during lockdown</a>, and they had been living in their bubble. Friends of Shailene don’t know believe Aaron is the best match for her.”</p><p class="x_x_p1 x_x_elementToProof">Since <a href=#>his breakup with</a> the Divergent star, 30, Rodgers has been taking time for himself. “I’ve focused on in the offseason about how to take care of myself — the total package,” he explained to Marcus on Wednesday’s podcast episode. “Not just <a href=#>my physical self with workouts</a> but my spiritual self with my own mindful practices, my mental health as well.”<span class=x_x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p2 x_x_elementToProof">The quarterback went on to say that he’s “very thankful for the opportunity <a href=#>to work on mental health</a>” and while he hasn’t dealt with any “bouts of depression,” he is still always trying to “think about what puts me in the best frame of mind.”</p><p class="x_x_p2 x_x_elementToProof">For Rodgers, that means a lot of “self-love” — something he has recently found in plant-based psychedelic drug ayahuasca, which the <a href=#>Alcohol and Drug Foundation</a> defines as a liquid that can affect a person’s thinking, sense of time and emotions.</p><p class="x_x_p2 x_x_elementToProof">While NFL star said he didn’t recommend ayahuasca to others, he did admit the drug <a href=#>had a profound impact</a> on his life.</p><p class="x_x_p2 x_x_elementToProof">“I laid there afterwards on my mat and then opened my eyes and it felt like I was opening my eyes for the first time,” Rodgers explained of his experience with the supplement.<span class=x_x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_x_p2>Scroll down for more revelations from Rodgers on the “Aubrey Marcus Podcast”:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrqK%2Bzqdkq6eUnLKzv4yopWaZpZe%2FpsWMppirm6WoeqWtzaKammWglsGztcKkZKudppq5osDIqKWsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cynthia-erivo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cynthia Erivo Celebrity Bio Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./unghetto-mathieu-20000120-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Unghetto Mathieu (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
