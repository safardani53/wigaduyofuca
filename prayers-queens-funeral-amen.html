Amen.</p><h3>Prayer for those who mourn</h3><p>Shermara Fletcher, who works for Churches Together in England, said she felt "honoured" at being asked to participate in prayers for the monarch.</p><p>She read the prayer for those who are feeling the weight of grief. She said:</p><p><strong>Confident in God’s love and compassion, let us pray for all those whose hearts are heavy with grief and sorrow.</strong></p><p>ALMIGHTY God, Father of all mercies and giver of all comfort: deal graciously, we pray thee, with those who mourn, that casting every care on thee, they may know the consolation of thy love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><h3>Prayer for the Royal Family</h3><p>Dame Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, led prayers for the Royal Family. She introduced the prayer by saying:</p><p><strong>Let us pray for His Majesty The King and all the Royal Family; that they may know the sustaining power of God’s love and the prayerful fellowship of God’s people.</strong></p><p>ALMIGHTY God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech thee to bless our most gracious Sovereign Lord <a href=#>King Charles</a>, <a href=#>Camilla </a>The Queen Consort, <a href=#>William Prince of Wales</a>, and all the Royal Family: endue them with thy Holy Spirit, enrich them with thy heavenly grace; prosper them with all happiness; and bring them to thine everlasting kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">READ MORE ON THE ROYAL FAMILY</h2></p><h3>Prayer for the nation</h3><p>Moderator of the Free Churches Group, <a href=#>Reverend Canon Helen Cameron</a>, led prayers remembering the Queen's service to the country.</p><p>The prayer asks for grace for the nation. She said:</p><p><strong>In recognition of Queen Elizabeth’s service to this United Kingdom, let us rejoice in her unstinting devotion to duty, her compassion for her subjects, and her counsel to her ministers; and we pray for the continued health and prosperity of this Nation.</strong></p><p>ALMIGHTY God, whose will it is that all thy children should serve thee in serving one another: look with love, we pray thee, on this Nation. Grant to its citizens grace to work together with honest and faithful hearts, each caring for the good of all; that, seeking first thy kingdom and its righteousness, they may possess all things needful for their daily sustenance and the common good; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><h3>Prayer for the Commonwealth</h3><p>Archbishop of Westminster, <a href=#>Cardinal Vincent Nichols</a>, led prayers for the wider world, giving thanks for the Queen's service.</p><p>The Cardinal who is head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales said:</p><p><strong>Let us give thanks for Queen Elizabeth’s commitment to the Commonwealth throughout her reign, for her service and dedication to its peoples, and for the rich bonds of unity and mutual support she sustained.</strong></p><p>O ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, hear our prayer for the Commonwealth, and grant it the guidance of thy wisdom. Inspire those in authority, that they may promote justice and the common good; give to all its citizens the spirit of mutual honour and respect; and grant to us all grace to strive for the establishment of righteousness and peace; for the honour of thy name. Amen.</p><h3>The Collect for Twenty-second after Trinity</h3><p>Prayer led by Archbishop of York, <a href=#>Stephen Cottrell</a>, remembered the Queen's dedication to her Christian faith.</p><p>Cottrell, who was one of eight people to formally proclaim King Charles III, said:</p><p><strong>We give thanks to God for Queen Elizabeth’s loyalty to the faith she inherited through her baptism and confirmation, and affirmed at her coronation; for her unswerving devotion to the Gospel; and for her steadfast service as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.</strong></p><p>LORD, we beseech thee to keep thy household the Church in continual godliness; that through thy protection she may be free from all adversities, and devoutly given to serve thee in all good works, to the glory of thy name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><h3>Prayer by John Donne</h3><p>The Precentor concluded the prayers with a verse written by poet John Donne. He introduced it by saying:</p><p><strong>Let us pray that we may be given grace to live as those who believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, and the resurrection to eternal life.</strong></p><p>BRING us, O Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate of heaven, to enter into that gate and dwell in that house, where there shall be no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light; no noise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears nor hopes, but one equal possession; no ends nor beginnings, but one equal eternity; in the habitation of thy glory and dominion, world without end. Amen.</p><h3>The Lord's Prayer</h3><p>After the choir sang "O taste and see how gracious the Lord is : blest is the man that trusteth in him" the Precentor led the congregation in the <a href=#>Lord's Prayer</a>.</p><p>He introduced it by saying:</p><p><strong>In confidence and hope, let us pray to the Father in the words our Saviour taught us,</strong></p><p>OUR Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p><h2>Prayers said at the committal in Windsor</h2><p>Reverend Canon Paul Williams, who is the Rector of Sandringham, led prayers at the committal.</p><p>REMEMBER, O Lord, thy servant Elizabeth who has gone before us with the sign of faith, and now rests in sleep. According to thy promises, grant unto her, and to all who repose in Christ, refreshment, light and peace; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>MERCIFUL Father and Lord of all life, we praise thee that thou hast made us in thine image and that we reflect thy truth and light. We give special thanks for the life of thy daughter Elizabeth, for the mercy she received from thee, and for the example that through her life of service, love and faith, she has set before our eyes. Above all, we rejoice at thy gracious promise to all thy servants, living and departed, that we shall rise again at the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ. We pray that, in due time, we may share with our sister that clearer vision when we shall see thy face in the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>O FATHER of all, we pray to thee for those whom we love, but see no longer. Grant them peace; let light perpetual shine upon them; and, in thy loving wisdom and almighty power, work in them the good purposes of thy perfect will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>O LORD, support us all the day long of this troublous life, until the shades lengthen and the evening comes, the busy world is hushed, the fever of life is over and our work is done; then Lord, in thy mercy, grant us safe lodging, a holy rest, and peace at the last; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>LORD God Almighty, King of creation, bless our King and all Members of the Royal Family. May godliness be their guidance, may sanctity be their strength, may peace on earth be the fruit of their labours, and their joy in heaven thine eternal gift; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>GOD save our gracious Sovereign and all the Companions, living and departed, of the Most Honourable and Noble Order of the Garter. Amen.</p><p>The prayers were finished by saying the Lord's Prayer as they did in the funeral service.</p><h3>The Blessing</h3><p>The <a href=#>Dean of Windsor</a> led the final blessing as the Queen's coffin is lowered into the <a href=#>Royal Vault</a>.</p><p>GO forth into the world in peace; Be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil; strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people, love and serve the Lord, rejoicing in the power of the Holy Spirit; And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit be among you and remain with you always.
