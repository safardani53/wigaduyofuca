Maybe you go for a little race against someone on the highway and smoke them, driving as safely as you can at super-fast speeds. While you pull up to a gas station to top off your tank and grab something to drink for the road, you avoid a gnarly pothole that could've spelled disaster for your rims.</p><p>You even manage to clock the cop waiting just a few hundred feet down the road, so you stop yourself from going into a full launch control, neck-breaking acceleration from a red light. You manage to dodge all of these things to go wrong, only to find yourself stopped in your tracks by nothing more than a humble plastic garbage bag.</p><p>That's what the owner of a whip featured on the Tuned in Tokyo <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@tunedintokyo</a> TIkTok account experienced, and seeing just how wrapped up the thick plastic bag got around the undercarriage of his car is enough to make any auto enthusiast wince in pain.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tuned.in.tokyo href=#>@tuned.in.tokyo</a><p>A trash bag attacked my Camry <a title=toyota href=#>#toyota</a> <a title=camry href=#>#camry</a> carsoftiktok <a title=jdm href=#>#jdm</a> cars ...</p><a title="♬ original sound - Tunedintokyo" href=#>♬ original sound - Tunedintokyo</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @tuned.in.tokyo</span></figure><p>A text overlay is emblazoned on the TikToker's video from the get-go, it reads: "Bruh, this p------ me off," and the car enthusiast doesn't waste any time explaining, and showing, what is specifically grinding his gears about the situation he's in.</p><p>A large, clear, and apparently stalwart plastic bag has wrapped around the custom rim of his front driver wheel. He tugs on the plastic, which appears to be deeply embedded in the wheel and doesn't look like it's coming out easily.</p><p>"So I hit a big trash bag on the freeway, and, yeah...cool," he says as he tries to free the bag from the tire of his car. "It's all in there," he demonstrates on camera, getting a closer look at the damage done to his whip. "F---- dude."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @tuned.in.tokyo</span></figure><p>The video then transitions to his car jacked up, the wheel off of his car, and the bag clearly wrapped around his axle: "It's all around everything dude," he says, showing just how much of an inconvenience driving over a garbage bag with one's vehicle can be.</p><p>"F---," he exclaims on camera, before transitioning to another clip that demonstrates the damage is even worse than he thought: the bag got wrapped up inside of his "axle boot."</p><p>He grunts and grumbles as he digs his fingers into the axle boot in an attempt to get the bag out and his frustration is palpable: "Oh my God! It's in my CV joint. F---," he says before the video then cuts to him sitting outside on the ground with a toolbox and various tools splayed out before him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @tuned.in.tokyo</span></figure><p>"This is what f---- happens when you hit a huge trash bag on the f----- freeway. It's in everything dude, it's everywhere" he says as he digs through the underside of his car, trying to take the plastic bag out.</p><p>"It's in my CV joint, it's in my control arm bushing, it's wrapped around my axle, it's under my brakes." There is some positive news he imparts upon his viewers, however: "I already got most of it off the wheel hub," which he shows off on camera, but it's clear he still has a ways to go.</p><p>"Holy s--- dude this is annoying," he says as he continues to paw through the plastic stuck underneath his car," before the clip ultimately cuts out.</p><p>While running over a plastic bag doesn't seem like the worst thing one could do to their vehicle, there are folks who've pointed out that drive belt and exhaust systems can be damaged by these bags.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @tuned.in.tokyo</span></figure><p>In fact, not only can your car sustain mechanical damage/problems, but the plastic, if sucked up into the exhaust system, can even result in a fire beneath your vehicle, leading to even more problems.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there have been reports from car owners in various forums</a> who've <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">found themselves</a> in similar situations to the @tuned.in.tokyo TikToker.</p><p>While for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most part it'll probably do little to do damage to your car</a>, there are instances, as evidenced by this unfortunate driver's video, where things can get out of hand and very, very frustrating in a split second. So it's probably best to try and avoid running over a plastic bag if you can.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6urcaeZJ%2Bqn6J6s8HNp6Cnn12kw6a%2BjK2pmquYYq%2Bisw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./scarlett-estevez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Scarlett Estevez Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./greg-louganis-net-worth-husband-gay-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Greg Louganiss Massive Net Worth &amp;amp; Gay Love With Husband | Detailed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
