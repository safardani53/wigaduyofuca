There was nothing outdated about the main event though.</p><p>As they thrashed through my favourites – Let’s Get Rocked, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Hysteria and Photograph – Def Leppard barely took a breath.</p><p>The biggest cheer of the night was reserved for Rick and his outstanding drum solo, which for a bloke who lost one of his arms in car accident in 1984 is as remarkable as it is impressive.</p><p>Frontman Joe and his bandmates Rick, <a href=#>Phil Collen</a>, Rick Savage and Vivian Campbell appeared overcome at times when they spoke to the crowd.</p><p>Joe said: “Monday night in Sheffield, all these years later, thank you for coming. We are loving this.</p><p>“I know a lot of people have come from all over the world to see where this band was born. “What a joy and a pleasure it is to bring it back here all these years later.
