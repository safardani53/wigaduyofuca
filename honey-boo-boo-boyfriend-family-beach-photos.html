The TLC reality star, 16, was spotted getting in some rest and relaxation on the beaches of Los Angeles on Thursday, July 7. It was definitely a family affair, as Alana and boyfriend <strong>Dralin Carswell</strong>, 20, were joined by her sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lauryn ‘Pumpkin’ Shannon</strong></a>, Pumpkin’s husband <strong>Josh Efird</strong> and their three children: daughter <strong>Ella</strong>, four, son <strong>Bentley</strong>, 11 months, and the newborn twins <strong>Sylus </strong>and<strong> Stella</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Honey-Boo-Boo-Beach-Family-BF-MEGA-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Alana and the crew enjoyed the sunny day out at the Santa Monica beach, as they played in the surf and took turns holding the newborns. At one point, Pumpkin and Josh shared an adorable smooch as the ocean waves crashed behind them. Later, the family was all smiles as they left the beach to explore the pier, filled with games and amusement park rides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Honey-Boo-Boo-Beach-Family-BF-MEGA-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>It’s good to see the family enjoying a holiday, as they have been going through some challenging times recently. In June, Pumpkin was granted full custody of Alana, who had been living under Pumpkin’s care since their mother, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mama June Shannon</strong></a>, began suffering from substance abuse disorder and was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested on drug possession charges</a> alongside her then-boyfriend&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Geno Doak. </a></strong>Mama June has reportedly been ordered to pay Pumpkin $800 per month in child support until Alana turns 18 years old in August 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Two weeks after the custody judgment, Mama June spoke out on it, saying Alana is choosing to stay with her sister, rather than her own mother. “Alana made that choice to stay in that environment,” Mama June told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. “People don’t understand the custody thing. It’s not like somebody ‘lost custody.’ In the state of Georgia, you do temporary guardianship every year and [Alana] had been with [Lauryn] in my addiction. Well, at the age of 12, you’re able to make your choice.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Honey-Boo-Boo-Beach-Family-BF-MEGA-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, Alana sparked engagement rumors when she was spotted with a sparkling ring in the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first snaps</a> of her twin niece and nephew. The former toddler beauty pageant winner has been dating <strong>Dralin </strong>for almost a year, so fans were eager to know if he had popped the question. However, her rep told Page Six that there are no plans for the two to walk down the aisle together at the moment — and that the ring was simply a ring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49xZqGnnprGbq7OqGSbp59ir7DFxaugnqaUYrOiucilsGaalZawqXnPoaatp6Nk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-duhamel-denies-stripper-shagging-calls-charges-ridiculous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Duhamel Denies Stripper Shagging, Calls Charges &amp;quot;Ridiculous&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-groban-wife-4986680.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Josh Groban Have A Wife?
