The lyrics "Last time the miscarriage was so tragic / We was afraid you'd disappear, but nah, baby, you magic," allude to their struggles, and Beyoncé openly talked about it more a year later in her 2013 documentary Life is But a Dream.</p><p>In her documentary, she described the experience as "the saddest thing I've ever been through."</p><p>At the time that Beyoncé initially opened up about it, she had already given birth to her oldest daughter, Blue, in January 2012. Five years later, she welcomed her twins, Sir and Rumi.</p><p>Beyoncé also said in her documentary that her experience with miscarriage inspired her to write "the saddest song I've ever written," though refused to name which song it was. There's been speculation that the song "Heartbeat" is about it, but the song never made the cut for her self-titled album.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Beyoncé said that she learned of her miscarriage at a routine doctor's appointment.

"Then I had Blue, and the quest for my purpose became so much deeper... It’s difficult for me to go backwards. Being 'number one' was no longer my priority. My true win is creating art and a legacy that will live far beyond me.
