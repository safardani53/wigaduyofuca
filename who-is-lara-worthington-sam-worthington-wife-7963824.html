Their son Racer arrived in 2016, followed by River in 2020. Between busy careers and raising their three boys, Sam told PEOPLE, “every second that I spend with my wife” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>is the happiest</a> part of his day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I have Valentine’s Day every day because my wife is the perfect gift,” the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Avatar: The Way of Water star</a> continued. “That’s why I love her so much — she can tell me how it is, all the normal stuff, fight, complain, but I love her for every piece of that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who is Sam Worthington’s wife?

She began modeling as a teenager in Australia and dropped out of school at 16 to pursue her career in Italy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2006, she booked a major advertising campaign for Australia’s tourism agency — but the ads turned out to be controversial. Lara was one of many Aussies who appeared in the commercial, each sharing how they prepared for visitors to come Down Under. A bikini-clad Lara ended the ad on a beach by saying the campaign tagline, "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>So where the bloody hell are you</a>?" While the word “bloody” is commonly used for emphasis in Australia, the ad’s international audience was not as familiar. "Bloody" was cut from TV commercials in the U.K., while Canadian regulators banned the commercial from playing during family programs because of the word “hell.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the controversy, Lara continued her busy modeling career. She has since graced the covers of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elle Australia</a>, Marie Claire Australia and Harper’s Bazaar Australia, and she’s made guest appearances on TV shows like Australia's Next Top Model. Her brand collaborations and ambassadorships include Speedo, Cotton On and Emma Lewisham skincare.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to her work as a model, Lara had her own reality TV series. Being Lara Bingle premiered in June 2012 on Australia’s Network 10. The series lasted for one season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lara has also appeared on reality competition shows. In 2006, she competed on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Torvill and Dean</a>'s Dancing on Ice, where she placed third with partner and pro skater Matt Evers.
