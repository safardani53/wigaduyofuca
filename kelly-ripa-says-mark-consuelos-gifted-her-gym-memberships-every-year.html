I’m glad that you stuck with it.”</p><p>Once Ripa understood the message, she followed Consuelos’ advice and began working out regularly</p><p>In November 2020, Ripa revealed her exercise regimen.</p><p>“I work out seven days a week. And I try to workout an hour and a half a day, no matter what — whether I’m working or not,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>InTheKnow.com</a>. “If I’m working, maybe I’ll start it a little bit later or a little bit earlier, depending on what day of the week it is. But I am very religious about my fitness.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think that energy begets energy,” Ripa continued. “There are people that say, ‘You must hate working out!’ It’s going to be so hard to push your way through [with that attitude], and I love working out. But it’s like developing a love for anything: You have to really practice it to love it. And, so, I found that years ago I really figured out that the more energy I put into the gym or left on the dance floor, the more energy came back to me.”</p><p><a href=#>Ripa and Consuelos</a> have been married for 27 years after they met while starring in All My Children in the ‘90s. They have three children, son Michael, 26, daughter Lola, 22, and son Joaquin, 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhxm6%2ByKmYZquRrsBuucCromabn6PAtrHLqKpmn5mbwaawjKGcq2WXrrpuucSmmZ6qo522sb%2BMnq2eqqlixqat0Wg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-mcculley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul McCulley</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-sex-tape-is-this-the-real-deal.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is This the Real Deal?!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
