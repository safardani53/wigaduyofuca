And when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jon Grabowski</u></a> and his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Liz Grabowski</u></a>, were approached to be the subjects of Born With Albinism, they welcomed the world into their lives to learn about their adoption story and four of their children, who were <a href=#><u>born with albinism</u></a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The TV special is meant to explain what the big family's life is like, as Jon and Liz have five adopted children and two older biological children. If viewers end up having a vested interest in Jon, Liz, and their kids, maybe the special will expand into a whole TV show. Before they grace your screens, though, you might want to get to know them all a little better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Liz and Jon Grabowski and their family?</h2><p>Like most of the other families who make their way to TLC, Liz and Jon's backgrounds are pretty average. Neither of them is famous and they haven't made a living by showcasing their family to the world on a famous blog just yet. Instead, they met in college like so many other couples and started expanding their family soon after they were married.</p><p>The family of nine is from California and, according to a story Liz wrote for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Love What Matters</u></a>, she and Jon decided on adoption well after their first two sons were born. At one point, they created a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel</u></a> to share videos of their kids, but it seems to have fallen off and never gained any traction.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>First Jon and Liz adopted Lily, who Liz wrote fit into their family "like a glove on a hand." She was a little girl with albinism from China and, just months after Jon and Liz returned home to the United States with her, they set about adopting again. This time, it was Mae, a young girl who doesn't have albinism but does live with brachial plexus nerve damage to her right arm.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Next came Nathaniel, a boy living with albinism, and after him, Liz and Jon adopted 5-year-old Kaelyn, who has albinism and had a difficult life up until that point involving neglect that resulted in delayed physical and mental development.</p><p>The last child they adopted is Emily, another little girl with albinism and just like that, Jon and Liz became a family of nine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jon and Liz Grabowski have two biological children too.</h2><p>Before Jon and Liz made the decision to adopt, they had two biological sons. Now, both sons are adults, but at the time of the family's first adoption, they were still kids, and the family gradually became bigger and bigger over the years.</p><p>Liz wrote that they had been happy as a family of four but felt God had pulled them in the direction of adoption.</p><p>Liz also shared in a 2012 newsletter for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chrysalis House</u></a> adoption agency that she has been "exhausted and overwhelmed" at times. Being a mom to so many and learning to help her children with different physical and emotional needs has its challenges.</p><p>Somehow, though, Jon and Liz have managed to make it work time and again and now, TLC has welcomed them to share their story on TV.</p><p>Born With Albinism premieres on TLC on May 18, 2021, at 10 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yvecCnm2akma96qL7Am6awq5ueeqetzKKjsg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-my-boobs-are-real-and-theyre-spectacular.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>My Boobs Are Real and They're Spectacular!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./good-burger-2-who-said-it-ed-or-dex.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Good Burger 2 - Who Said It: Ed Or Dex?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
