The “Livin’ La Vida Loca” artist also welcomed 14-year-old twins Matteo and Valentino<a href=#> via surrogate</a> in 2008.</p><p>Martin and Yosef, an artist, first met “through Instagram, believe it or not,” Martin revealed on Paramount+’s Behind the Music in 2021. “I saw his art, and I’m like, ‘Who’s the artist?’ and it said ‘Jwan Yosef,’ and I’m like, ‘That’s such a cool name, but I wanna see his face.’ And then when I saw his face, I said, ‘OK, this is over. What a beautiful man.'”</p><p>After their Instagram meet-cute, the pair continued to text for six months until Martin flew to London to meet Yosef.</p><p>“When I got out of the car and I saw him, I said, ‘Whoa. Wait a minute, I think this is the man of my life and I think I am going to marry him,’” Martin recalled.</p><p>After tying the knot, Martin revealed that he and Yosef hit a rough patch following Lucia’s birth in 2018. In June 2020, Martin told<a href=#> Univision</a> that he “had problems with my husband” due to his — Martin’s — desire to be in control. “[Jwan] would say, ‘Let me change her,’ and I would say, ’No! I’m going to change her,’” Martin recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ricky-Martin-Jwan-Yosef-Divorce-What-Went-Wrong-3.jpg><p>Three years later, the ex-couple announced their split in a statement to People on Thursday, July 6.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We have decided to end our marriage with love, respect and dignity for our children and honoring what we have experienced as a couple all these wonderful years,” the duo said. “Our greatest desire now is to continue having a healthy family dynamic and a relationship centered on peace and friendship to continue the joint upbringing of our children, preserving the respect and love we have for each other.”</p><p>Martin and Yosef’s split comes one year after Martin’s brother accused the musician of having an inappropriate relationship with his nephew<strong> Dennis Yadiel Sanchez</strong>. Martin’s lawyer <a href=#>slammed the “awful” and “disgusting” allegations</a> to Us in July 2022, noting that “the person who made this claim is struggling with deep mental health challenges.” The case against Martin was dropped later that month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroZOgxm65wKuroqZdlrulecmwmKdlqaTAprKMrKeloaRixKmt02aunqakYsSzu82gZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-voice-2023-live-updates-coaches-tonight-recap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Voice 2023 LIVE Niall Horan slammed for 'big mistake' as Nini Iris and Alexa Wildish's fates</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./unexplained-baby-death-county-durham.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Probe launched into 'unexplained' death of baby after cops called to County Durham home</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
