The pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secretly</a> tied the knot in a private ceremony in March 2020, about three months after their Dec. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>engagement</a>. Their nuptials came while the Oscar nominee was pregnant with the pair’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first child</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Hart Kail</strong>, who was born in June 2020. And most recently, on Nov. 1, 2022, Michelle and the&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;director welcomed their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second child</a> together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Thomas and his wife met while working together on FX’s&nbsp;Fosse/Verdon&nbsp;in 2019. Michelle starred in the series as the character Gwen Verdon alongside&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sam Rockwell</strong></a>. Her hubby was previously married to Broadway actress <strong>Angela Christian</strong> from 2006 until their split in 2019. And in Jan. 2020, Michelle and Thomas made their relationship red carpet official by attending the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Golden Globe Awards</a> together.</p><h2>Phil Elverum</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The Emmy-winning actress first walked down the aisle with musician <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Phil Elverum</strong></a>, 44, who she married in 2018. Her ex has been a part of multiple music groups including Mount Eerie, The Microphones, Old Time Relijun, and D+. Phil’s marriage to Michelle was also not his first, as he was married to Canadian singer <strong>Geneviève Castrée</strong> from 2004 to 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Michelle and her first husband’s marriage was short-lived, as the duo <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits</a> by April 2019, less than one year after getting married the summer prior. The year that they got married, the actress opened up about their marriage to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>. “Obviously, I’ve never once in my life talked about a relationship, but Phil isn’t anyone else. And that’s worth something. Ultimately the way&nbsp;he loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole,” she said at the time. “I work to be free inside of the moment. I parent to let <strong>Matilda</strong> feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.”</p><h2><span class="x_ContentPasted2 x_ContentPasted3">Heath Ledger</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/michelle-williams-heath-ledger-everett-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Michelle</a> and Heath were never actually married, it might be one of her most significant relationships. The late actor, who died on Jan. 22, 2008, and Michelle met in 2004 while working together on the set of the groundbreaking movie, Brokeback Mountain. Sparks flew instantly with these two, as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their daughter</a>, Matilda, was born on Oct. 28, 2005.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When speaking about meeting the&nbsp;10 Things I Hate About You&nbsp;actor to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ&nbsp;</a>in 2012, Michelle called it magical. “Our initial meeting, the circumstances of how we first met, were cosmic or something,” she said at the time. “Yeah, a lot of things happened at once,” Michelle added. “It’s a bit like: We had a lot of things to do, because we didn’t have a lot of time, or something.” Sadly, tragedy struck when Heath died in 2008 due to an accidental prescription drug overdose, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>History</a>. Notably, Michelle and Heath were engaged soon after meeting in 2004, and made their red carpet debut at the 2006 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscars</a>. But soon, they called it quits by Sept. 2007, about four months prior to Heath’s untimely death.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Michelle also told the outlet how difficult it was having paparazzi swarming her home at the time, as she was trying to protect her daughter from it all. “It was making me crazy. I felt like I was going crazy. It was too much—trying to deal with what had happened and trying to deal with what was at our doorstep. I just felt trapped. And it’s not just me—there’s somebody else who I’m trying to protect, and I can’t. I can’t make it stop, I can’t make it go away,” the starlet said. “Trying to find ways to explain it or shield her from it. It’s like you’re trying to go about your life, and make dinner…but the roof is off of your house, and the walls are falling down.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yimqGdnKGybsPIpaOimZ2oeqnB0puYp5xdaYZxf5JubGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./murray-cook.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Murray Cook</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-gomez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Gomez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
