If you ever see someone lifeless on the floor, in the recovery position you can tell it's serious.</p><p>"It was scary knowing Raul has a young baby at home and his partner Daniella would have been watching. That's where it stemmed from - the worry and the not knowing what was going to happen to him.</p><p>"But at times like that as football fans, that's really when we come together - regardless of who we support - and back players to the hilt.</p><p>"We were having a conversation about what we could do to show Raul support while no one was in the stand.</p><p>"We were just expecting it to be a small pitch-side banner but it snowballed from there.</p><p>"Within an hour of setting up the crowd funding page we had hit the initial target of £7,500 which was unbelievable. And then it went mad and we were way above it within a couple of hours.</p><p>"We wanted it to be completely fan led and we didn't want the club to be too much a part of it as we wanted to show Raul it was from the fans rather than the club.</p><p>"We had designs from Mexico, Australia and America.</p><p>"This has made Wolves' fans' bond with Raul even stronger."</p><p>Jimenez shared a video of the artwork and wrote: "Amazing!</p><p>"I am very grateful to all the people who have been supporting me during this process.</p><p>"To my fans, to my team-mates, to all who have sent their love, it means everything to me and my family. Thank you very much!"</p><p>Fans also flew a get well banner over the stadium ahead of Wolves' game against Aston Villa on Saturday lunchtime.</p><p>A plane flew past with the words: "Get well soon Wolves AYWE."</p><p>The heartfelt message followed by the fan slogan was broadcast to millions of TV viewers around the world and quickly went viral on Twitter.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Earlier this week <a href=#>Jimenez returned to Wolves' training ground for the first time</a> since the incident at the Emirates.</p><p>And his dad also <a href=#>insisted the striker's horror&nbsp;injury 'won’t have any consequences</a>' on his playing career.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Raul Jimenez is back home after head injury, Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo confirms</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2aAdYGVbm5xZ6KWwq15yaKknqaVr3q1vsibrK2dXay8rcLErGSbmZ6jsrN5zKijoqaVqsVutMSam2ahnp%2FCs8WO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-aiza-seguerra-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Aiza Seguerra Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-goodall.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Goodall</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
