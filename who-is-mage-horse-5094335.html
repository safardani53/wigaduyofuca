He’s a second-generation jockey and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>racing runs in the family</a>. His father, uncle, and brother have all been jockeys.

Here’s what the winner and the rest of the field’s odds were, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>. (However, Mage’s odds after the win were listed as 15-1. meaning that even though he was a longshot, his odds improved.)</p><li>Hit Show 26/1</li><li>Verifying 17/1</li><li>Two Phil’s 7/1</li><li>Confidence Game 16/1</li><li>Tapit Trice 9/2</li><li>Kingsbarns 10/1</li><li>Reincarnate 13/1</li><li>Mage 17/1*</li><li>Disarm 24/1</li><li>Jace’s Road 32/1</li><li>Sun Thunder 30/1</li><li>Angel of Empire 9/2</li><li>Raise Cain 30/1</li><li>Derma Sotogake 7/1</li><li>Rocket Can 27/1</li><li>Cyclone Mischief 32/1</li><li>Mandarin Hero 21/1</li><li>King Russell 32/1</li><h2><strong>They Won The Derby With The Most Scratches In Nearly 90 Years.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>If the above didn’t make it clear, the 2023 Kentucky Derby ran with 18 horses total, down from the usual field of 20. This reduced field comes after Forte, the 3-1 favorite to win, became the fifth horse to ‘scratch’ – aka to be withdrawn – from the race. Churchill Downs said Forte co-owner Mike Repole attributed the scratch to state veterinarians’ worries over a bruised right foot, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Washington Post</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kentucky-derby-mage-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Practical Move withdrew due to an elevated temperature. Continuar was pulled for lack of fitness. Skinner pulled out due to an elevated temperature, and Lord Miles was pulled in part to trainer <strong>Saffie Joseph Jr. </strong>being indefinitely suspended – more on that in a bit. These scratches allowed Cyclone Mischief, Mandarin Hero, and King Russell to compete in the Kentucky Derby, but the field was still reduced to 18 horses. Overall, it’s the most scratches in a Kentucky Derby since 1936.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>It’s believed that the Derby with the most scratches is 1933’s. In the past twenty-three years, only ten races have run with a full field.</p><h2><strong>…But All Horses Coming Out Of The 2023 Derby Are Winners.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Racehorse trainer Saffie Joseph Jr. was suspended indefinitely on May 4 after two horses he trained died suddenly from, as of the time of publication, unknown causes. “The suspension prohibits Joseph, or any trainer directly or indirectly employed by Joseph, from entering horses in races or applying for stall occupancy at all [Churchill Downs Inc.]-owned racetracks,” the organization said in a statement on Thursday, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>. “CDI’s decision follows the highly unusual sudden deaths of two horses trained by Joseph at Churchill Downs racetrack: Parents Pride on Saturday and Chasing Artie on Tuesday.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kentucky-derby-mage-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-21>This is why Lord Miles was pulled from the race. CDI had “reasonable concerns about the condition of his horses,” and suspended him “until details are analyzed and understood.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Parents Pride and Chasing Artie, unfortunately, weren’t the only horses who died in the lead-up to the Kentucky Derby. There were six confirmed deaths going into the race. Wild On Ice, another Kentucky Derby contender, was hurt while training on Apr. 27. Take Charge Briana was injured during a race on May 2. Both were “euthanized for humane reasons,” claimed Churchill Downs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Chloe’s Dream was injured during an undercard race on Saturday. “He just took a bad step out there,” trainer Jeff Hiles said to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Associated Press</a>. “They could do the same thing running in the field as they could on the track. So it’s very unfortunate. That’s what we deal with.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>Racehorse Freezing Point was also injured during their undercard race and was euthanized. “It doesn’t make me happy to see a horse get euthanized,” said racegoer Joe Conforto, per AP. “But I think a lot of it is bad luck. Most racehorses are taken better care of than human beings.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>The deaths and suspension come just weeks before the governing body of horse racing is about to enact new anti-doping and medication rules. Infamously, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first at the 2021 Kentucky Derby but was stripped of the win after failing a post-race drug test. Medina Spirit died later that year after a workout at a track in Southern California, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NPR</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6orPEZp%2BoqqOaenZ8mG1qbG1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alfie-sheard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alfie Sheard</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-inherits-the-comedian-bernie-mac-s-net-worth-that-accumulated-until-his-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Inherits Bernie Mac's Net Worth?
