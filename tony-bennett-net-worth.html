However, Tony's retirement did not yet signal the conclusion of his career, and on Sept. 30, 2021, he released an album with Lady Gaga titled "Love for Sale."</p><p>Tony has also broken several Guinness World Records. In 1962, he broke the record for the longest span of top-10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart for any living artist, and his "Love for Sale" album broke the record for the oldest person to release an album of new material.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Between his record-breaking albums and astounding performance history, it should be no surprise that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> lists Tony's estimated net worth as $200 million.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Tony Bennett</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer, Painter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $200 million</p><p>Tony Bennett is an American singer of pop standards, big band, show tunes, and jazz.</p><p>After fighting as a U.S. infantryman in the final stages of World War II, Tony signed with Columbia Records in 1950. His first hit, "Because of You," went number one in 1951. He has since won 20 Grammy Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards, and he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for valor in combat.</p><p><strong>Birth date</strong>: Aug. 3, 1926</p><p><strong>Birth place</strong>: Queens, New York City</p><p><strong>Birth name</strong>: Anthony Dominick Benedetto</p><p><strong>Marriages</strong>: Patricia Beech (m. 1952–1971), Sandra Grant (m. 1971—1983), Susan Crow (m. 2007—)</p><p><strong>Children</strong>: D'Andrea "Danny" Bennett, Daegal "Dae" Bennett, Joanna Bennett, Antonia Bennett</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Tony Bennett?</h2><p>In August 2021, following his 95th birthday concert, Tony's son and manager Danny announced that Tony would be retiring from all future performances and canceled the last of his in-person concert tour. In a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Danny explained, "Doing concerts now is just too much for him," he said. "We don't want him to fall on stage, for instance — something as simple as that. We're not worried about him being able to sing. We are worried, from a physical standpoint ... about human nature."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Tony's wife, Susan Crow, also put her foot down out of concern for Tony's health. "She said, 'Absolutely not.'" The singer's son revealed to the public in 2020 that Tony had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2016. People have been astounded Tony was still performing live and making music with his condition, and to those in disbelief, Danny has something to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"Dealing as we have with Alzheimer’s for the last four-five years, it’s cognitive. He has short-term memory loss. That, however, does not mean that he doesn’t still have all this stored up inside of him. He doesn’t use a Teleprompter. He never misses a line. He hits that stage and goes. Tony may not remember every part of doing that show. But, when he stepped to the side of the stage, the first thing he told me was: ‘I love being a singer.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyvxYybnKemlanBbrrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./five-for-fighting.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Five for Fighting net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./scorpion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scorpion Season 4 Episodes - Watch on Paramount+</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
