history.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about <a href=#>King Charles III's</a> countryside estate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-king-spending-private-day-761071915.jpg><h2>Where is Highgrove House?</h2><p><a href=#>Highgrove House</a> is located in the <a href=#>Cotswolds</a>, just miles from Tetbury in <a href=#>Gloucestershire</a>.</p><p>It's close to the walking trails of Westonbirt Arboretum and the Arts & Crafts country house, Rodmarton Manor.</p><h2>When did King Charles purchase Highgrove?</h2><p>The Georgian home dates back to the 1780s and was bought by the then-Prince Charles from Maurice Macmillan, a former politician in 1980.</p><p>The home provided quick routes to <a href=#>London</a>, <a href=#>Wales</a>, and many of the other properties under his watch at the time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN ROYALS">READ MORE IN ROYALS</h2><p>Each of the gardens reflect the interests of <a href=#>King Charles</a>, who has long held a deep commitment to <a href=#>environmental </a>efforts and a sustainable lifestyle.</p><p>The King has even planted rare trees and heritage seeds to ensure these varieties continue flourishing for future generations.</p><p>It's been reported that King Charles III will <a href=#>have a quiet day of reflection at Highgrove</a> after days of public tributes to his mother Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>But under royal protocol, Highgrove technically belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate owned by the Duke of Cornwall.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON KING CHARLES</h2></p><p>Following the <a href=#>death of the Queen</a>, his son <a href=#>Prince William</a> has been named the new <a href=#>Duke of Cornwall</a> and will take ownership of the home.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Daily Mail</a>, in order for King Charles to stay at Highgrove, he would have to pay Prince William around £700,000 a year in rent.</p><h2>Is Highgrove open to the public?</h2><p>Highgrove is located within 347 acres of sprawling countryside with the Royal Gardens often open for tours, including group garden tours and champagne and tea tours.</p><p>There is even a shop that sells artisan products like ports and chutneys.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>All profits from the produce on sale, garden tours and events are donated to the <a href=#>Prince of Wales’ Charitable Fund</a>, which supports <a href=#>mental </a>and physical health activities, the arts and the environment.</p><p>Highgrove House itself is closed to the public as it is the private home of King Charles III and the <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a>.</p><p
