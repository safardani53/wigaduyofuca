The <strong>Maroon 5</strong> singer and the Victoria’s Secret model were spotted treating their two daughters <strong>Dusty</strong>, six, and <strong>Gio</strong>, four, to a bike ride to the beach in Los Angeles on Saturday (October 8).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/adam-levine-behati-prinsloo-backgrid-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Adam rocked a tank top as he traveled on his bike with the kids sitting in the front of it, while Behati showed off her baby bump by keeping her shirt rolled up above her cut off denim shorts. After they arrived to the coast, Adam and Behati got cozy in the sand, wrapping their bodies together as they kept an eye on Dusty and Gio.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In September, Adam was first accused of sending flirty DM’s to model <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sumner Stroh</strong>&nbsp;</a>— along with four other women — who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared</a> their text conversations on social media. In a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>public apology</a>, Adam admitted to using “poor judgement” and claimed he did not have an affair. “Nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life,” he&nbsp;added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, just as the scandal seemed to be blowing over, Saturday Night Live brought it back in the spotlight on their season premiere, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>skewering</a> the “Harder to Breathe” hitmaker in a hilarious sketch about sending “normal” DMs. While the bit got huge laughs in Studio 8H, it didn’t exactly go over well with Adam, according to a source that spoke EXCLUSIVELY with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“He&nbsp;feels the same about this that he does about&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the other memes and jokes</a> that have been going around about it,” the insider said. “He does not think it is funny and he thinks that it is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>disrespectful to Behati.</a>&nbsp;He is unimpressed and, of course, he is still embarrassed. He just wants this to all blow over and wants his fans to just focus on his music, not his personal life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>A second source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife that Adam is also doing damage control in his home, making sure Behati is feels safe and supported during her pregnancy. <span>“The last thing that he ever wants is for her to be stressed out during her pregnancy and he feels so awful that this is happening,” the insider said. “Adam knows how close he came to losing everything and he is so incredibly thankful that she has not run away from him over this. He loves Behati and his kids so much. He just wants this to all be behind them.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49yZpqckaJ6rbHVoqWeZZKataLAyGanq6GeqLmwu4ykoJ2rXZnCtMDYZp6ip12XsqKvx2anoaekpMBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oscar-best-pictures-2015192.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Picture Oscar Winners From the Past 25 Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kayla-erin-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kayla Erin Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
