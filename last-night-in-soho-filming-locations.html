The psychological thriller follows young Ellie (Thomasin McKenzie), an aspiring fashion designer in modern-day England, whose sixth sense transports her back to 1966 London in the body of a nightclub singer named Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, Sandie's life isn't all it's cracked up to be, and Ellie finds herself embroiled in a race against time as the past and the present fall apart. With the film's location so central to its plot, many fans are wondering where Last Night in Soho was filmed. Here's everything we know about the flick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What were the filming locations for 'Last Night in Soho'?</h2><p>The title of the film refers to Soho, a neighborhood in London's West End that is notorious for being a center of sex work, theatre, and nightlife. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a> interview with director Edgar Wright reveals that most period pieces filmed in England are filmed in East London or in the northern cities of Liverpool and Manchester.</p><p>However, thanks to another famous director, Edgar felt encouraged to film Last Night in Soho in the busy Soho neighborhood from which the film takes its title. During the time that Edgar was writing the Last Night in Soho script, Quentin Tarantino was filming Once Upon a Time in Hollywood on Hollywood Boulevard, no easy feat for such a heavily trafficked area. Quentin's ability to quickly transport the modern-day street to the past gave Edgar the inspiration he needed to do the same.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hollywood Boulevard's hustle and bustle has nothing on crowded Soho, which is described by THR as "a messy jumble of tight-knit roads wedged haphazardly between London’s theater district and its busiest shopping high street." "We went into that movie knowing how difficult it was going to be,” Edgar said of the filming process.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Thankfully, Edgar revealed that his locations team worked with Westminister authorities to secure streets for filming at night, often between the hours of 3 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. Soho is never truly quiet, as several actors came to realize when they were interrupted during evening shoots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Matt Smith, who portrays Sandie's sleazy boyfriend Jack, recalled a group of people coming out of the Groucho Club one night during filming. "And they were like, ‘All right mate! Are you coming out for a beer?’" he said. "I’m like, ‘A beer? I’m dressed in ’60s clothes, and there’s a camera over there — I’m shooting a scene, mate!"</p><p>Co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns used to work in the Toucan Pub, a key location in the film where they were also able to shoot scenes. She explained that "between takes, I’d go outside, and my old regulars would walk by, and they’d be like, ‘Oh, are you back?'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It sounds like despite more than a few interruptions, Edgar Wright's gamble during filming has paid off successfully.</p><p>Last Night in Soho is out in theaters on Oct. 29, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa60wIynoKCgpGK2r3nSqJ%2BoZZaeua61zaBkpaeTlsGqu82s</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./veronika-loubry.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Veronika Loubry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shanna-moakler-bikini-tummy-tuck-mommy-makeover-pic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shanna Moakler In Bikini After Tummy Tuck &amp;amp; Mommy Makeover Pic Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
