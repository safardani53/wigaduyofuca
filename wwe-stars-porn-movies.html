career for themselves inside the wrestling ring, others have been forced to earn cash elsewhere.</p><p>Legends such as Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and Dave Bautista are making plenty of dosh for themselves in Hollywood as actors on the silverscreen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425698673.jpg><p>However, not everybody is as fortunate as them when it comes to their roles in movies.</p><p>In fact, a number of ex-<a href=#>WWE</a> performers have turned to the <a href=#>porn industry</a> to help bring in the cash with mixed success.</p><p>Sun Sport takes a look at ten wrestlers who have ventured into the adult entertainment industry:</p><h3>10 BUFF BAGWELL</h3><p>Buff ‘The Stuff’ was a huge hit with WCW during the Monday Night Wars before going on to endure a miserable stint in <a href=#>WWE</a>.</p><p>He continued to wrestle for independent promotions before deciding on a new career as he admitted to being a full-time gigolo for a company named "Cowboy 4 Angels" - charging women $3000 a night.</p><p>Bagwell also penned a contract to work for adult entertainment company Vivid Entertainment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Buff-Bagwell-1.png><h3>9 BEULAH MCGILLICUTTY</h3><p>Best remembered by ECW fans as the gorgeous valet to Raven and the childhood love of Tommy Dreamer.</p><p>Despite looking like a real sweetie, her naughty side was revealed when a video of her in another kind of action emerged online.</p><p>She later went on to pose in a number of saucy and explicit snaps but would go on to write and publish a children's book called “Gertrude the Great” in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/03_ECW_Beulah.jpg><h3>8 BUBBA RAY DUDLEY</h3><p>Yes that’s right, Bubba Ray Dudley has starred in a porn movie alongside the legendary Ron Jeremy.</p><p>The ECW and WWE legend became friends with adult film director Rob Black in the 90s, the husband of Lizzy Borden.</p><p>That friendship led to him fulfilling one of his ambitions to direct a porn movie under the guidance of Black.</p><p>And Bubba even got a clothed cameo in the movie titled “Whack Attack” that also starred Jeremy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dIPw2f5Q.jpg><h3>7 MICKIE JAMES</h3><p>Mickie James is well-known to WWE fans after achieving legendary status inside the ring.</p><p>She also enjoyed huge success with rival promotion TNA.</p><p>But before making the breakthrough in the wrestling business she used to pose nude for a number of websites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mickie_James-bio-3cfc8ebc05b1c4ebca7ef2261d90aea9.jpg><h3>6 X-PAC</h3><p>The WWE hall of famer was hugely popular in the late 90s but found himself released after the turn of the century.</p><p>That led to him turning to his wild side to remain relevant alongside his then fiancee Chyna.</p><p>The pair starred in a home-made adult movie called “One Night In China” and it actually proved to be really successful, winning several awards and remaining a best-selling adult film for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xpac_bio.jpg><h3>5 GANGREL</h3><p>Best-known as the leader of The Brood during the Attitude Era, the vampire-like star was later fired due to being overweight.</p><p>That led to a dramatic career change as he became a director of adult films.</p><p>In 2007 he agreed a contract to direct 12 films for a company named “New P**n Order” under his Vampire Warrior ring name with his first movie titled “Miami Rump Shakerz 2”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/830cb-1509384431-500.jpg><h3>4 CHYNA</h3><p>The late, great Ninth Wonder of the World was rightly inducted into WWE’s hall of fame last year.</p><p>Following her iconic wrestling career she decided to do that home-made movie with X-Pac.</p><p>After its success, Chyna later starred in a sequel to that and signed a deal with adult film moguls Vivid Video.</p><p>In total she appeared in three films for the company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000311666370.jpg><h3>3 SHELLY MARTINEZ</h3><p>After a short-lived career in WWE as part of ECW she went on to work for TNA.</p><p>But she enjoyed much more success away from the ring after becoming a pin-up model and starring in a softcore bondage video named “The Notorious Jewel De'Nyle & Shelly Martinez”.</p><p>Martinez would later pose nude for several magazines and she is now the official Hollywood correspondent for horror news website MoreHorror.com.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

MICHELLE</h3><p>After coming through WWE’s “Divas Search” programme the star went on to become hugely-popular with fans.</p><p>But before her breakthrough in the wrestling business she was an aspiring actress who tried her hand in some B-movies.</p><p>Although she never acted in any hardcore films, she did star in softcore productions Hogtie Heaven and HBO’s Hotel Erotica.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/c57a1ddcb6d9fb2db1b4c6df7e0f9df7.jpg><h3>1 SUNNY</h3><p>Sunny, aka Tammy Sytch, was a huge hit with wrestling fans, particularly men, during the 1990s and switched to starring in porn movies after stepping away from the ring.</p><p>After her wrestling career nosedived, the once most downloaded person on AOL began posing nude for Missy Hyatt's adult website called “Wrestling Vixxxens”.</p><p>Sunny then signed a deal to star in an adult film for Vivid Entertainment and angering WWE by wearing her hall of fame ring during the movie.</p><p>Now she has found a new way to make money through adult website Only Fans - used primarily by people to release more revealing photos and videos for fans who pay a monthly subscription fee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
