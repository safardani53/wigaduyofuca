It’s been a year since I’ve had it.’ I was like, ‘Today’s not the day, sorry,’” Kardashian, 43, told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Wall Street Journal</a> during an interview published on Monday, September 12.</p><p>The reality television personality’s comments came after she was asked whether her kids feel “deprived” of junk food.</p><p>The <a href=#>Kardashians star</a> — who shares Mason, <a href=#>Penelope</a>, 10, and <a href=#>Reign</a>, 7, with her ex <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a> — is launching a line of vitamin and supplement gummies called Lemme later this month. She told the WSJ that <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></a> helped get her into eating healthier by recommending she read the book Super Baby Food.</p><p>“It taught me about organic products and, honestly, it changed my life on <a href=#>how I started eating</a>. Then it was a snowball effect. You can’t unlearn information, right? By the time I was pregnant with Penelope, I was fully in it and doing different kinds of cleanses — like I did a Panchakarma cleanse. All these different things that I was getting into really changed my life, [down to] home-cleaning products,” she told the outlet.</p><p>During season 1 of The Kardashians, the Poosh founder and <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>, who she <a href=#>married in May</a>, did the Ayurvedic Panchakarma cleanse together to <a href=#>increase their chances of conceiving a child</a>. The Kourtney and Kim Take New York alum told the WSJ that her fertility treatment journey is on pause for the moment.</p><p>“We <a href=#>started an IVF journey</a>, but I stopped. It was a lot. I took a break to just focus on our wedding and getting married,” she said.</p><p>Kardashian and the Blink-182 drummer, 46, had an <a href=#>unofficial wedding in Las Vegas</a> in April followed by an official exchange of vows in California and a lavish Ceremony in Italy the following month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Lemme founder is now stepmom to Barker’s two children with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Shanna Moakler</strong></a>: <a href=#>Landon</a>, 18, and <a href=#>Alabama</a>, 16. The “All the Small Things” musician is also a father figure to 23-year-old <a href=#><strong>Atiana De La Hoya</strong></a>, Moakler’s daughter with ex <a href=#><strong>Oscar De La Hoya</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Kardashian-Barker kids</a> actually <a href=#>helped bring the happy couple closer</a> together. “They became friends living in the same neighborhood and hang out a lot,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly in January 2021 of the now-stepsiblings. “Their kids’ friendship had Kourtney and Travis spending a lot of time together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZKygpanAbrDOsKVmq5%2Bjeq6t0qilrGWimr62sdKtZJ%2BnomK6pLDOp5ilnKNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./molly-shannon-family-car-accident-5069147.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Learn The Details Here Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kanye-west-vma-2010-performance-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kanye West VMA 2010 Performance Video</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
