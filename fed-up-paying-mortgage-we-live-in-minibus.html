In the winter we were really busy, could be all night, all weekend."</p><p>Emily added: "I used to be a stress head, I was always thinking of saving, what if the boiler breaks.</p><p>"I liked the idea of retiring. When we added up what we were paying to live in our house that shocked me.</p><p>"I thought that's a lot of money to just live in a brick building.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>"We could live a lot better life by not living in brocks and mortar and a rat race where we're going to work, passing each other in the night, doing the same thing.</p><p>"Stressed about work. Our conversations were only ever about work."</p><p>Dave agreed: "I'd never put money back into bricks and mortar."</p><p>The pair took about a year renovating and converting the van, which they nabbed for £9,000.</p><p>Originally the transformation budget was set at £20,000, however they rapidly exceeded this and ended up using credit cards to complete the project.</p><p>But, they say they have no regrets and claim "it's the best thing they could have ever bought".</p><p>Dave said: "We spent an absolute fortune on it and if we sold it we would never get our money back on it."</p><p>Emily said: "But we don't want to sell it. We never had any intention of making money from it."</p><p>The new perks include not having to wake up at the crack of dawn to work and then "give your money to somebody else", according to Dave.</p><p>Emily agreed and said: "We're so much happier."</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>VAN TOUR</h3><p>On the roof the couple installed 610 watts of <a href=#>solar</a>, storage boxes and Dave's "escape" - an area of decking to catch some rays with "nice beer and a chill out".</p><p>The exterior was painted by the van renovator, who claimed all you need is paint, a roller and a coat of enamel.</p><p>They carry two gas tanks on board which powers up their cooker and heats the water - while three jerry cans filled with diesel are kept for emergencies on the road.</p><p>There is also an awning, although Dave didn't recommend buying one as you are not allowed to roll them out unless at a designated campsite.</p><p>Additionally there is an outside hot and cold shower should they need it.</p><p>As you walk into the converted minibus, there's overhead storage above the windscreen and two of the front seats have been allocated as comfy dog beds for their pets.</p><p>Moving through the light and airy vehicle, you find a cosy kitchen area with white cupboards and wooden counter top.</p><p>It boasts two gas hobs, grill, oven, sink, and fridge freezer - as well as large windows to overlook the beautiful countryside.</p><p>A skylight keeps the area feeling bright.</p><p>Behind the kitchen there's a bathroom with a shower and compost toilet - which the couple say is brilliant and easy.</p><p>In their bedroom they have a seating area which doubles as a dining area as a pull out table comes out and retracts back underneath the double bed.</p><p>Perhaps the coolest thing in the van is a projector screen which doubles as a divider to the bedroom and the pair's own home cinema.</p><p>A window from the bed also lets Emily relax while being able to watch the views.</p><p>Dave described the benefits to van life and said: "My favourite thing has been being relaxed and chilled out, meeting the people we've met.</p><p>"But, my least favourite part is using google maps - absolute nightmare. I've ordered my sat nav today."</p><p>Emily added that the most special thing for her was the freedom.</p><p>She said: "You can go wherever you want, whenever you want.</p><p>"The downside is you have to be careful with water, and the washing.</p><p>"But there's nothing really. Maybe we've not been doing it long enough to know yet."</p><p>Emily also offered some advice to others who are thinking of making the same lifestyle change.</p><p>She warned: "Research your vehicle and make sure you know what you're doing.</p><p>"Be prepared for things to go wrong. Loads of things happened to us."</p><p>The couple urged anyone who was fed-up with the stress of everyday life and the same old routine to give it a go.</p><p>They agreed they would love to do it as long as they can.</p><p>Many other people are making the same jump into vanlife.</p><p>Some Brits are embarking on the same journey to save money on bills as the&nbsp;<a href=#>cost of living</a>&nbsp;sees millions across the nation struggle.</p><p>A man who made the bold move said he<a href=#> loves the freedom of going off-grid - and escaping the cost of living crisis.</a></p><p>Paul, aka, The Off Grid Nomad, was fed up being left with just £100 to play with at the end of every month&nbsp;<a href=#>amid soaring bills.</a></p><p>The proud "lorry life" community member now travels across the British countryside in his ex-military converted truck.</p><p>Meanwhile, another couple <a href=#>converted an old van into their dream tiny home on wheels.</a></p><p>Tom and Iz, known as the Lost in Transit duo on<a href=#>&nbsp;social media</a>, share what life is like living on the road.</p><p>Another woman revealed&nbsp;<a href=#>she lives in a van and absolutely loves it </a>because she can travel and save money<a href=#>.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Vin said she doesn't care that people call her “homeless”, and enjoys the lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>And a family of four had the same idea<a href=#>&nbsp;and ditched everything to live in a van.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/king-road-fed-paying-mortgage-864058600.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/king-road-fed-paying-mortgage-864058601.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/king-road-fed-paying-mortgage-864058602.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgJhta21rZ2SzprCMrqdmqJGutq%2BzjKamq6yXlrSmedaeZKWhppp6qrqMpqCnoZKqwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-marilyn-monroe-have-plastic-surgery.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Marilyn Monroe Have Plastic Surgery?
