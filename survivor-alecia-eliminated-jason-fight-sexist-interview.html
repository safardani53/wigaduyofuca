You&nbsp;missed out a lot of that! I made a mistake&nbsp;by sharing the clue with Cyndey. I just&nbsp;wasn’t thinking. Anyway, me and Jason and he ended up finding it. What you didn’t see was Scott and Cydney were talking, so I got a machete and tried to chop down the tree; producers started yelling at me. So, I&nbsp;tried to climb up — I got half way but it was too windy. You also didn’t see that during that run to get it,&nbsp;Jason was standing next to me and with all his force, elbowed me down onto the rocks.&nbsp;He has absolutely no respect for women and is a bad role model for his daughters.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>Do you feel like you were fairly portrayed?</strong><br>I was ok out there! I did fight back a lot more than what was shown. They were just stereotyping me right away because I&nbsp;wasn’t as big, as them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>What’s your&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;with them now? What will it be like when you see them at the finale?<br></strong>I don’t plan on having any type of conversation with them.&nbsp;I was more or less laughing&nbsp;at them. If you’re going to&nbsp;set that type of role model and have daughters, that’s all you.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>[jwplatform afykM0pg]</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>When you were sent home, Scott said they hoped you’d get why they treated you that way when you watched back. Did you?</strong><br>I find it comical.&nbsp;Scott telling me I’m a cheerleader? Really, most of your NBA career was spent on the bench cheering your team on, so you know all about cheerleading. He&nbsp;was literally the dinosaur of the tribe. He’s old, he’s lazy, he wasn’t even that beneficial in our challenges. I made the fire, and he quit on me and went to sleep. I sat out there in the sun for five hours. ‘Weak’&nbsp;is not having food and water; if you’re just gonna quit and sleep all day, that’s weak. I don’t think I was a weak player.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>What about Cyndney? She didn’t really stand up for you.&nbsp;Before that last tribal did you try to change her mind?</strong><br>I thought I could trust her after the first episode, but I quickly learned I really couldn’t trust anyone in my tribe.&nbsp;I tried to get Cyndney to go against them and I tied to find the immunity idol for hours.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Would you do another season?</strong><br>I’m dying to go back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Was there anything you wish was shown that wasn’t?<br></strong>At&nbsp;the first challenge, Cydney was trying to grab anything and everything, and she stuck fruit down her pants; when she got back it was spoiled so she threw it in the sand. I went and cleaned it and fed it to them. Another thing was Jason, who is all talk — he thinks he’s&nbsp;such a bad boy. Well, he let our chicken out and he couldn’t catch it, Darnell had to.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Were you upset Alecia was sent home,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH10e5BpZqytoqu2t7vRZpilnZOerm6xy6KkoqaRqbKlecmaqqimXZu2qLTTZqqesJmowW61za2cq66ZmsRw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barbra-streisand-did-not-see-lea-michele-funny-girl-broadway-8374677.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Barbra Streisand Didn't See Lea Michele's Funny Girl on Broadway</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./torry-holt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Torry Holt</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
