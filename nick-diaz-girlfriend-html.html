As a kid from an unstable family, he moved from school to school, facing bullies&nbsp;and depending&nbsp;on prescription drugs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The trouble intensified as his mother&nbsp;lost her house after a divorce from his father.&nbsp;Following this, Diaz moved to his grandparent's house in Lodi, California. He&nbsp;joined a new school and was constantly bullied. They would beat him up and put him on drugs.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But as they say, every cloud has a silver lining. One good thing that happened was Diaz <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">found&nbsp;his first love</a>, Stephanie, in the school. He was head over heels in love with her, and the feeling was somewhat mutual.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the relationship came at a price. Stephanie's ex-boyfriend, a senior and the mascot on the football team, made things hard. Diaz was frequently involved in big fights with members of the football team.&nbsp;</p><p>In consequence, he was kicked out of the school. To find a balance in his life, the Stockton native started training to be a pro fighter.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The unforeseen change brought a rift in his relationship. And&nbsp;his girlfriend started hooking up with his friend, Bart, to make him jealous. The estrangement, however, disappeared once the duo talked at Bart's party.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Henceforth, the pair planned to go to Stephanie's house with her brother. But as Diaz's friends weren't doing that great, he headed to his home, only to find&nbsp;what was coming next would change his life forever.</p><h2>Nick Diaz's Girlfriend Died By&nbsp;Suicide</h2><p>Just an hour after Diaz reached his home, he got a surprising call from his girlfriend's mother. She asked if Stephanie was with him. He said no, and within minutes, she was in front&nbsp;of his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Without speaking much, she took him to the Frontage Road on Highway 99. Upon arriving at the freeway, the <a href=# rel=follow>professional fighter</a> saw an ambulance and a car. It didn't take him long to realize that his girlfriend had committed suicide.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It was Stephanie's third attempt at killing herself, and sadly, she had succeeded.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her unexpected death changed Diaz forever, and he found himself running seven miles and back repeatedly, visiting her grave to promise he would make it as a fighter.&nbsp;After all, Stephanie had believed in him and said she was proud of him.</p><p>Honoring her trust, Diaz has&nbsp;etched his name as a competitive fighter in the fighting world.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Diaz shared accounts of his heartbreaking love story to MMA Fighting in September 2015, after he was suspended from UFC for five years.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Nick Diaz Have a Wife?</h2><p>Since the tragedy, Diaz has moved on in his life. He was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly dating</a> a woman named Heather Nikole around 2015. But the details of their relationship and breakup were never public knowledge.</p><p>With that said, the 38-year-old has not been romantically linked with any woman since the split. His Instagram is also void of hints of his personal life.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Ergo, it is safe to say that Diaz doesn't have any girlfriend, let alone a wife, at the moment. Instead, he has been focusing on his career since returning to the octagon. He&nbsp;fought Robbie Lawler at UFC 266&nbsp;on September 25, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaZmLhusMiasWafmae5p77InqWdZpipuq0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oxj418vkykytq6gxubu6ztka9ccxwugd.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Concacaf Nations League Season 2023 Episode 75: Bermuda vs. St. Vincent &amp;amp; the Grenadines</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./valerie-bertinelli-my-body-then-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>My Body Then &amp;amp; Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
