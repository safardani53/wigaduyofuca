"Long before that, the Negro Leagues made baseball better and America better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Negro Leagues folded in the early 1960s, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Negro Leagues Baseball Museum</a>. They were first formed by "barnstorming" Black baseball clubs who traveled the country playing exhibitions, primarily in the Midwest and the South.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because of Jim Crow laws enforcing segregation and racism, Black ball players weren't allowed to play in the white Major Leagues until Robinson famously stepped on the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers during the '47 season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For decades, racism prevented some of the greatest baseball players in the U.S. from playing in the Major Leagues — including Gibson and Paige, who only spent the tail end of his Hall of Fame career in the MLB.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his video message on Monday, Bush, wearing a Texas Rangers for the team he once partially owned, tipped his hat in honor of other Negro Leagues legends like Willie Mays, who he said was his favorite player growing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It turned out Willie Mays played in the Negro Leagues for a brief period of time," Bush, 73, said.
