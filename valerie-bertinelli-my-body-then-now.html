That was for OC magazine," Bertinelli says. "[The outfit] reminded me of the green hot pants my mom made for me when I was 12. That's why I put them on. I think it was right before I got married [to Eddie Van Halen]. I felt pretty good, and then as my marriage started to deteriorate, so did my psyche and my self-esteem. Look how young those legs are.

I just see a sad little girl," Bertinelli recalls. At the time, the actress was doing drugs. "[Back then] I thought, 'Oh my God, look at how thin I am! This is amazing.'

I also think I look prettier as a nun. I did not have a stylist, as you can see," says Bertinelli of this promotional photo for the TV movie Shattered Vows. "I would always wear big stuff. I was probably around where I am now, within the 125- to 132-pound range. When I got married I was 110, so I felt fat at 125. Stupid.

In fact, I probably got a little arrogant in my twenties," Bertinelli remembers. "I had renewed confidence. Thinking I'm beautiful. Maybe getting a little cocky." But, she says, it was her lifestyle as a rocker's wife that helped fuel a "false" sense of good self-esteem.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1989></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1989</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Charles W.

"But there's no definition â€“ that was just not eating. I got a little too thin."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2002></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2002</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeff Vespa/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More than a decade later, Bertinelli â€“ who was on TV again, this time for Touched by an Angel â€“ found herself in a different kind of weight struggle. "I was so happy that I could actually tuck a shirt in and put a belt on," she recalls. "Because I was all the way up to 162 or so [before this], I was so happy to get down to 150. This was probably right before Ed [Van Halen] and I separated. I lost a lot of weight and then I gained it right back and went wacko, like, way over."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2005></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2005</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Guastella/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bertinelli admits that at the time she liked that this size-12 suit was baggy on her "because then I thought, 'Ooh, I'm thin,' " she recalls.
