every night, while 15 percent admit they can’t sleep without it, a nationwide survey has found.</p><p>17 percent confess they still cuddle a teddy when they’re upset, and nearly one in ten (nine percent) say they’d rather share a bed with their teddy than their own partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000491866287.jpg><p>The study found almost half (44 percent) of the nation have held onto their teddies and dolls, whether at their house or their parents’ home.</p><p>In fact, four in ten Brits have a room in their parent's house which remains packed with all their childhood dolls and teddies, with five percent of adults demanding their old bedroom is kept the same as it always was, as a shrine to their youth.</p><p>The research, commissioned to mark the launch of Hotpoint’s new ActiveCare washing machine, found eleven percent of British adults have taken their special soft toy on holiday with them, and five percent have even sneaked it into work.</p><p>That means that there are some well-travelled toys in the world, with <a href=#>the average British teddy bear</a> having journeyed a whopping 1,365 miles.</p><p>And despite the fact they may need a wash after all that travel, they’re only cleaned once every seven years.</p><p>As our childhood toys are so well loved, it’s no surprise that when they do go missing the effects can be severe.</p><p>24 percent of people who had misplaced a teddy or doll said they felt “devastated” by the loss of their beloved toy.</p><h2>VITAL FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLD</h2><p>Teddies and other soft toys are still important for modern families, with 63 percent of parents saying that they are “vital” for their household and a third (33 percent) saying they couldn’t manage bedtime without them.</p><p>And 53 percent of parents saying that it has been a “nightmare” when their child lost their special soft toy.</p><p>The study found that the average British parent will spend 6 working days a year hunting high and low for lost special toys in their household.</p><p>Jennifer Taylor, Head of Brand at Hotpoint, commented “This research proves the lasting influence teddies have on the nation. They can provide a great source of comfort at all stages of life, and we understand how losing or damaging them can cause significant emotional upheaval.</p><p>"With teddy bears being such a well-travelled member of the family, Hotpoint is on hand to care for them with our ActiveCare range, which washes at just 20 degrees.</p><p>"And for those lost bears, we’re hoping that our lost and found labels will help parents (and adult teddy bear lovers alike) get reunited with any lost favourite toys as quickly as possible.”</p><p>The study found that men are more likely to say they have thrown away teddies, with only 34 percent saying they’ve <a href=#>held on to their favourite comforting bear</a>, compared to half of women.</p><p>However, when the teddy bears were lost, men were more devastated than women, with 21 percent saying they felt like they’d lost their best friend, compared to just 19 percent of women.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN UK NEWS</h2></p><p>Plymouth was the most teddy-reliant city in Britain, where nearly three quarters (74 percent) of adults admitted clinging on to their soft toys.</p><p>Understanding the emotional importance of teddy bears Hotpoint is giving away thousands of lost and found labels to help ensure that any lost toys are reunited with their owners as quickly as possible.</p><p>Hotpoint will be giving away the specially created ‘Lost & Found’ labels via the Hotpoint Facebook page from Monday 20th May.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000491866288.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Build-A-Bear - How to build a custom bear online just like you would in the store with personalised touches such as voice recordings</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbn5zgpJrZ2ismJ6%2FpXnBq6CtZZGZwq3A0maqpZ2VpXq1scOdsGaalZa%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-teeth-whitening-pen-7966700.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Best Teeth Whitening Pens of 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-markle-wore-pearl-earrings-from-queen-to-westminster-service.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Markle Wore Pearl Earrings From Queen to Westminster Service</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
