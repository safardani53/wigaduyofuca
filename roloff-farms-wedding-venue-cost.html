According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wedding Chicks</a>, high school sweethearts Erica and Jessie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got married there in November 2012</a>. At that time, they only paid $500 for the venue because it was featured on an episode of the TLC show.</p><p>But if you wanted to keep your wedding day more private around that time, it would have cost you $2,500. Keep in mind that these numbers are about a decade old; things are different now.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> reported that Amy and Matt Roloff were offering the farm up for weddings. Couples would have the venue for two-hour blocks of time with 25 guests, and their son Zach's wife Tori would be the photographer. Altogether, it would cost $850.</p><p>But it seems they are no longer offering this service. The page on their website with the info is no longer up. It may be possible to plan something if you get in contact with the farm directly, but no guarantees.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Weddings on the farm aren't completely a thing of the past, though. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy and her husband Chris got married</a> there in an episode of Little People, Big World. The two tied the knot on Aug. 28, 2021, in front of 146 guests, including their families and friends.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will you still be able to get married at Roloff Farms after it's sold?</h2><p>Luckily for fans, Matt isn't selling the whole property. Instead, he's scaling down to a more manageable piece of land. So even though it looks as if the farm isn't hosting weddings now, it might in the future. On the farm's website, Matt mentions that he's looking forward to pumpkin season in 2022, so fans may still have access to at least that area.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>For now, it's not clear exactly why the Roloffs stopped hosting weddings on the farm, and there's no word on when they will be back to hosting such events. It could have to do with the fact that Matt is selling it, but <a href=#>it hasn't sold yet</a>. It is possible that whoever buys it could choose to ride the fame and host weddings there.</p><p>You can watch Little People, Big World on TLC and Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7ytu8WfZJ%2BZoqLAbsPEnZuippdiw6a61J5knKejqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rainbow-rock-band.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Rainbow (rock band) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-grande-likes-post-about-never-dating-someone-you-fear-again.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ariana Grande 'Likes' Post About 'Never' Dating Someone You Fear Again</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
