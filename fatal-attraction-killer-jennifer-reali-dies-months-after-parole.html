Just as she got out, she got this diagnosis.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The son of Reali’s victim, Dianne Hood, has said he forgave her for her crime, “in Christ’s name.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Grief can take many different forms, but as someone who has lived this and now is helping others as a professional counselor, I believe in the power of forgiveness,” Jarrod Hood <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the Gazette in 2017</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jarrod said Dianne, a “beautiful and kind person,” “taught me to be a good sport and to walk in the fruit of the Spirit … I will honor her legacy by continuing in the way of Christ.

(Last year his son said he also was okay with his father being paroled.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brian was sentenced to 37 years in prison and is serving his sentence in Sterling Correctional Facility in Sterling, Colorado. He is next eligible for parole in February 2019 and, according to the Gazette, has previously sought early release without success.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Colorado Department of Corrections</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Colorado Department of Corrections</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Reali’s sentence was commuted, allowing her to seek parole, a spokesman for Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter said the decision was made in part because she and Brian Hood “shared responsibility, and this commutation brings balance to the conviction and the sentencing,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the Denver Post reports</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John Suthers, who prosecuted Reali for murder, told the Gazette before her parole thatshe posed little risk of reoffending and had helped convict her onetime lover.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She didn’t have an opportunity to have much of a life with her children,” he told the paper. “All around, it’s a very tragic story.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dianne’s sister-in-law echoed Suthers’ support for Reali’s parole, according to the Gazette, but was critical of her insistence that she had been the object of another’s manipulation. “She wasn’t a victim,” Angela Moore said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At her October parole hearing, Reali said she had changed and regretted what she did decades ago, according to the Gazette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It makes me mad, very mad, that somehow I could come to a place that I did that,” she said.
