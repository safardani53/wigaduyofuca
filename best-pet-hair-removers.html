"It was clear from the first few wipes that it was working exactly as it advertised," they shared, later stating how easy it was to remove embedded hair. "It was satisfying to see how well it performed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tool's triangular shape allows you to use its differently-grooved sides to dig out even the most lodged hairs, and its easy clean up process makes this product a standout. Its small size makes it easy to store in a car compartment or even your pocket for quick, on-the-go cleans, but that's not to say it's inefficient for around the house. In fact, this product is recommended for use on smaller surfaces like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>throw pillows</a> or chair armrests – wherever your furry friend likes to lounge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, due to its small stature, this tool would not be ideal for bigger cleans. While it's possible, it would be quite labor intensive, and there are better tools out there for cleaning large surfaces. But for a quick pick up, the Analan is your new best friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Tool |<strong> Material: </strong>Plastic, non-slip coating | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>4.72 x 4.72 x 0.78 in. | <strong>Weight: </strong>7.05 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-evriholder-furemover-pet-hair-removal-broom></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Evriholder Pet Hair Removal Broom</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon FURemover Extendable Pet Hair Removal Broom" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/IrC5CdNStCgtc4XAXplFSBxy6g0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-furemover-extendable-pet-hair-removal-broom-8ff6f5459de64b37bac4698923a6c03a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This squeegee-like tool has a handle that can be extended from 3 to 5 feet</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Budget-friendly price tag</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We were able to easily extract embedded hairs from high-pile carpets and rugs</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Evriholder tool is mash up between a broom and squeegee and is ideal for those tough-to-clean <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>area rugs</a> and carpets. For a combination of two cleaning tools, the $17 price tag makes this product hard to beat. Equipped with rows of unflagged rubber bristles at the end of the tool, picking up hair in thick rugs has never been easier. "When using it on a high pile rug, the hair came up in a ball that was easy to pick up," our tester recorded. Cleaning the tool was made simple due to the rubber bristles attracting the hair into a large clump, so it could be easily extracted from the broom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only grievance with this budget-friendly option was the length of the handle. "When using it on my hands and knees it felt too long, but when standing it felt too short," the tester shared. It depends on personal preference, but the ability to extend or shorten this handle should minimize the discomfort for anyone who's interested in the Evriholder tool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Broom |<strong> Material: </strong>Plastic, unflagged rubber bristles | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>36.9 x 1.65 x 7.9 in. | <strong>Weight: </strong>14.72 oz.</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3333 data-sizes=750px alt="Evriholder FURemover Broom Pet Hair Removal Tool with Squeegee" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Q4FGCLU_sGWofKtOigiQjtCfg6E=/fit-in/1500x3333/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-Evriholder-FURemover-Broom-Pet-Hair-Removal-Tool-with-Squeegee-vicky-wasik-photo-28.jpg-9b397e4d2c82420fb7a730c0c10f953e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Vicky Wasik</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3840 data-sizes=750px alt="Evriholder FURemover Broom Pet Hair Removal Tool with Squeegee" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Nq47KzpHA9V1IMQSbwiBc1L_R18=/fit-in/1500x3840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SPS-PEO-Evriholder-FURemover-Broom-Pet-Hair-Removal-Tool-with-Squeegee-ConorRalph-02.jpg-842322bd41c944bc9841bb9b940ae851.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-laundry-smart-sheep-wool-dryer-balls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Laundry</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Smart Sheep Wool Dryer Balls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Smart Sheep Wool Dryer Balls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/uDwzD7-hFSQpiv-0sZWQMR8I3So=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/smart-sheep-wool-dryer-balls-faeada24663e401491be4610571bf134.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The hair removal process is hands-free; just throw a few in the dryer with your clothes<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>These woolen balls cut down the overall dry time of your clothes</p></li><li readability=0><p>As reusable alternatives to single-use dryer sheets, this product is environmentally friendly</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the most unconventional of the list, these Smart Sheep dryer balls are made from 100 percent premium New Zealand wool and have a textured surface to pick up the stray pet hairs that stick to your clothes. This pack comes with a set of six dryer balls, and it's recommended to use three of the wool balls for a small load of laundry and five to six for larger loads. Our tester was amazed by the results, sharing that it was "a completely hands-off way to get pet hair off of clothing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to this, these wool balls will cut down on your clothing's drying time as it absorbs water and is an eco-friendly alternative to single-use dryer sheets.

We've found that certain products, like handheld tools, work best on furniture and in hard-to-reach places, while brooms are ideal for rugs or carpets. And when it comes to clothing, our tests showed that it's hard to top the wool dryer balls. Pinpointing the type of tool you'll need for your space will help take the guesswork out of picking a pet hair remover.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Purpose</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes you just really need a small tool to throw in your bag when you're on the go and you spot those few stray hairs. Or maybe you're having friends over and you need a quick fix for your couch before friends sit there and become covered in cat hair. Knowing the areas you need to clean the most regularly and what you do in those spaces is another important aspect to consider when looking for a remover tool.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Pet</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Probably the most important consideration of all is your pet. Oftentimes cats and dogs require different care tools, which is why it's crucial to know what kind of fur your companion has and its shedding tendencies. If your furry friend tends to shed often, then you may need a bigger tool for larger (and more frequent) clean ups than a pet with little shedding, that only needs a touch up here and there. Consider getting a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>robot vacuum</a> to stay on top of the pet hair. Incidentally, an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>air purifier</a> can also filter out some of your pet's hair so less of it ends up on surfaces.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-pet-hair-removers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Pet Hair Removers</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each of the 21 products that were tested in the PEOPLE lab were evaluated on design, performance, and ease of cleaning. Our testers began by bringing in clothing, pillow cases, and furniture covers from their homes with their pet's hair already on them, and synthetic hair was provided as a prop to simulate hair on other surfaces. Depending on what the product was designed to clean, such as floors, furniture, or clothing, they were tested accordingly. After rating them based on sheer looks and design, they were tried on different surfaces and then cleaned and rated on a scale of one to five for each of the aforementioned categories.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>FAQs</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you remove dog hair from fabric?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have dog hair stuck on machine washable and dryable fabrics, try placing the items in the dryer for a few minutes before washing.

Start by putting on a pair of disposable rubber gloves and wiping the entire couch down with your hands. You'll be able to loosen and remove most of the hair.

Use clean or disposable rubber gloves to wipe up the fur and remove it from the furniture. You can also vacuum suede furniture using your vacuum cleaner's upholstery setting. Many pet hair removers have the potential to damage leather furniture, read the product information before using it on your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leather sofa</a>, for example.
