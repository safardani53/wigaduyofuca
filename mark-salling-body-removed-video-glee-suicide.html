The ex-Glee star was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>found dead from an apparent suicide</a>, as law enforcement officials tell <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> that Mark was found “hanging from a tree” near a river bend in Sunland, California. Mark was reportedly found dead near a little league field adjacent to a creek, and from the looks of the video, it’s possible he wasn’t immediately in view.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The LAPD were called to do a “welfare check” on mark, according to TMZ. This ultimately led them to the baseball field where his body was found. A member of Mark’s family reportedly went to the LAPD sometime around 3 AM on Jan. 30 to report him as a missing person. Sadly, when he was found, he was no longer with us. Homicide detectives are on the scene to make sure this wasn’t a case of foul play, but sources tell TMZ that all signs are pointing to suicide by hanging.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp;There was no suicide note found near Mark’s body — he was found by pure luck, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before his death, Mark was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography. The ex-Glee star was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested in 2015</a> after the police conducted a raid on his California home. Prosecutors say he had 50,000 images of underage children on his computer, and it looked like he was going away for a long time – until he cut a deal. Mark’s guilty plea would have sent him away for 4 to 7 years. Afterward, he would be registered as a sex offender, would be banned from being around anyone under the gage of 18, and would have to pay $50,000 to each of his victims.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mark-slling-body-removed-forest-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=715 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment,” Mark’s lawyer <strong>Michael J.
