Sort of.</p><p>But that aired after they had broken up again (in real time). In fact, <a href=#>Ximena had flaunted her new man</a>.</p><p>Except, Ximena then unveiled a different new man.</p><p>What’s going on — and who is Ximena dating right now?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ximena Cuellar, also known as Ximena Morales, is kind of a mess.</p><p>She goes back and forth on what she wants, and her decision-making is strikingly immature.</p><p>Maybe that’s a surprise given how hard her life has been. Or maybe her life is the cause of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When Mike Berk first flew down to Colombia, Ximena was unsure, but quickly became smitten.</p><p>(Meeting someone in person for the first time is always complicated … chemistry can blossom or wither)</p><p>Ximena had some notes on some of Mike’s grosser habits, but she was overjoyed when he proposed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Then, after Mike returned to the United States, things changed.</p><p>He noticed that she had grown distant.</p><p>Mike planned to return to Colombia to plan their wedding together … and to find out what was wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Obviously, the couple had many issues — most significantly, a huge and frustrating language gap.</p><p>Everything that they said was filtered through a flawed translation app … which only made matters worse.</p><p>But upon his return to Colombia, Mike quickly saw how dramatically Ximena’s mood had changed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Suddenly, she was no longer interested in having sex with him.</p><p>Time apart had given her time to think about his unpalatable habits, and she had simply lost interest.</p><p>While anyone can fall out of love at any time, what made this weird was that she hadn’t broken up with him.</p><p>Then again, it wasn’t so “weird” when one considered his financial contributions.</p><p>When Mike and Ximena first “met,” she was working as a camgirl, and he was not content to be a sugar daddy.</p><p>Instead, he apparently offered to pay to meet all of her needs so that she would quit her job — giving attention only to him.</p><p>Perhaps Ximena hoped that she would fall back in love with Mike.</p><p>Or maybe she just wanted to drag out the engagement in order to maintain her lifestyle.</p><p>We do not know her true motives. But we do know that viewers, for the most part, did not like Ximena.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, that does not mean that everyone is a big fan of Mike — not anymore.</p><p>After a series of soft rejections, Ximena gave Mike a more firm rejection … and he did not take it well, running off into the night.</p><p>His Paul Staehle impression over, he returned to Ximena’s home, where he insulted her and her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Worse, Mike refused to leave when Ximena asked, which turned this ugly moment into a scary one, too.</p><p>Don’t get us wrong, the production crew was there, but a man refusing to leave his girlfriend’s house when she dumps him … that’s bad.</p><p>Mike’s harsh words made it extremely clear that he felt that he had “bought” Ximena with his generosity. Super gross.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When the Tell All was filmed in January of 2022, Mike and Ximena were sort of back together.</p><p>They had issues to work out. And Ximena wasn’t prepared to say that she’s “in love” with Mike.</p><p>However, reports quickly circulated that the two had been filming in Colombia, indicating that they were reunited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Then, in February, Ximena seemed to accidentally post and delete one of her cheesy lovey-dovey videos.</p><p>This video was not about Mike.</p><p>Instead, it was about a Canadian named Josh Romeo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ximena quickly set about distancing herself from Mike.</p><p>She got a new tattoo, this time to cover up her simple “Mike” tattoo on her wrist.</p><p>But if you’re wondering if Ximena and Josh are endgame … not quite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The guy in front is reportedly named Brian.</p><p>Ximena went Instagram Official with him — despite having described herself as “sola” (single).</p><p>We don’t know much about Brian, but Ximena has been posting pics with him as recently as a couple of weeks ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Honestly, it feels like Mike and Ximena both dodged a bullet — each other.</p><p>Odds are pretty good that we’ll see them again on 90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days, since they were reportedly filming for the spinoff.</p><p>We might find out how they broke up. We might even see Ximena and Mike as they move on.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WEcMTIppynmV2ivLOty56qZq%2BYpHqqv4yhnKtlnJbBpr%2FTZpmosZantqa6w2aYn6yVp3qutcqeZJudoqB8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-taylor-hing-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Taylor Hing Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-drew-dixon-russell-simmons-accuser-4077377.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Drew Dixon? 5 Things To Know About Russell Simmons Accuser Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
