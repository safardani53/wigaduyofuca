And … she’s not exactly singing his praises, folks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/david-and-annie-discuss-money.png><p>So, David Toborowsky’s from the US. Annie Suwan’s half his age, and from Thailand.</p><p>Annie hales from an impoverished community (not all of Thailand, folks, just her hometown) and is looking for a guy who can and will take care of her.</p><p>David’s daughter, Ashley, who’s 28 (remember, he’s twice Annie’s age) appeared on 90 Day Fiance, and she did not exactly gush about her father.</p><p>In fact, she straight-up told Annie that the guy’d been a cheater and deadbeat dad.</p><p>And now <a href=#>Ashley Toborowsky gave an interview to Auntie’s&nbsp;Advice</a>, and she explained exactly where she’s coming from in terms of her father.</p><p>"He might say he wants to be back with his kids but that’s not the truth."</p><p>Meaning that her appearance on 90 Day Fiance was more of a stunt to make him seem less selfish.</p><p>"He’s been a very selfish person his whole life."</p><p>Some people are like that.</p><p>"Yes, he loves his children, but does he want to be responsible for people?"</p><p>Love is good, but being a parent is a lot of responsibility. If you just want to love kids with zero responsibility, be an aunt or uncle and visit them from time to time.</p><p>"No, he doesn’t want to be responsible for people."</p><p>Interesting, since Annie is counting on him to be her provider.</p><p>"He wants to do what David wants to do."</p><p>Now, plenty of people feel that way. And that’s fine.</p><p>What’s not fine is feeling that way, having kids anyway, and continuing to care only about your own desires and to generally put your wishes first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/david-and-annie-on-the-plane.png><p>Ashley did have some very positive things to say about her dad’s best friend, Chris.</p><p>Now, as you may recall, Chris and his wife, Nikki, have been very generous to David and even appeared on 90 Day Fiance, without getting paid, in order to support their friend.</p><p>It was after a shocking episode aired that Chris and Nikki took to social media to reveal what they’d experienced.</p><p>See, during the episode, Chris had asked Annie for a massage to repay him for allowing her and David to stay with them.</p><p>That’s super gross. Like, even before all of the stuff that we’ve heard about Weinstein and so many others, we all recognized that this was not an appropriate request.</p><p>(Asian women in particular have been fetishized, often portrayed as sex workers — particularly in the context of massage parlors. Which made the request extra gross)</p><p>Well, Chris and Nikki — who were not under contract to keep quiet — revealed that the producers had asked Chris to say that, in order to stir up drama with viewers.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>Technically, that’s better than if Chris had come up with the creepy suggestion himself, but it’s pretty disheartening.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/90-day-fiance-couple-david-and-annie.png><p>We bring up Chris because, well, Ashley herself does.</p><p>She had a lot to say about her dad, but she seemed to have just as much to say about her dad’s best friend and his wife.</p><p>"They’re nice people. I know that Chris has definitely helped my dad a lot."</p><p>Like, a whole lot.</p><p>"Chris has definitely opened up his heart and his arms to Dad. Like I said they’ve been best friends."</p><p>Chris and Nikki have gone above and beyond for David, it sounds like. But they go way back.</p><p>"He watched my Dad go through the divorce with my Mom. Nikki, I don’t really know much about her. I’ve only seen her on the show and that was it."</p><p>Ashley was close to her father when she was younger, but they grew apart as, she says, she saw him for who he really was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/david-and-annie-of-90-day-fiance.png><p>Ashley spoke about her father’s fiancee, Annie:</p><p>"She’s nice. You know she doesn’t speak to us really. She’s dad’s wife, girlfriend, fiancee. Whatever you want to call her."</p><p>That sounds like an accidental slip-up — it was reported a while back that David and Annie ultimately did end up getting married.</p><p>Ashley does not mince words when she describes her father — she says that what you see of David on 90 Day Fiance is what you get.</p><p>"An a–hole? Yeah. Authentically? Yeah. He can’t fake that one. Everyone can see exactly what that is. That wasn’t scripted. That’s dad."</p><p>That’s sad.</p><p>"I may come off as harsh on the show to my dad. Some people might see me as disrespectful and that’s okay. I’ve had a very crazy relationship with my dad."</p><p>It sure sounds like it.</p><p>Best of luck to Annie with her new life, we guess.</p><a href=#><img width=2000 height=1364 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/josh-and-aika.jpg alt="Josh and Aika" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>90 Day Fiance: Meet the Season 5 Couples!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z%2FcIWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5knZmmnrG0ecOarKCgpJq%2FbrHXqaasnaNitaq5jJqqZpldqLKtssisn2aclZaxo7HArWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ivan-hernandez-19760806-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ivan Hernandez (Doctor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-over-40-flaunt-sexy-legs-pics-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebs Over 40 Flaunt Their Sexy Legs Pics Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
