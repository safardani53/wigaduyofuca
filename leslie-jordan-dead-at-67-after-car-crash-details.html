The Call Me Kat star was killed following a car accident on Monday, October 24, his rep confirmed to Us Weekly.</p><p>“The world is definitely a much darker place today without the love and light of Leslie Jordan,” Jordan’s representative, <strong>David Shaul</strong> of BRS/Gage Talent Agency, said in a statement to Us. “Not only was he a mega talent and joy to work with, but he provided an emotional sanctuary to the nation at one of its most difficult times. What he lacked in height he made up for in generosity and greatness as a son, brother, artist, comedian, partner and human being. Knowing that he has left the world at the height of both his professional and personal life is the only solace one can have today.”</p><p>Jordan was driving in Los Angeles on Monday morning, and it’s suspected that he “suffered some sort of medical emergency and crashed his BMW into the side of a building,” <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Leslie-Jordan-Dead.jpg><p>The comedian has over 130 screen credits dating back to 1986, and some of his most memorable characters include Lonnie Garr on Hearts Afire, Beverley Leslie on <a href=#>Will & Grace</a> and Mr. Blackly in The Help. Most recently, he has been a series regular on<a href=#> Call Me Kat </a>alongside <a href=#><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong></a>.</p><p>In addition to his work in film and TV, Jordan had a comedy career, selling out shows in Mexico, Canada and the U.K. The Tennessee native released his memoir, How Y’all Doing? Misadventures and Mischief From a Life Well-Lived, in April 2021, where he opened up about accepting that he was gay as a Southern Baptist and living as a recovering addict (he got sober when he was 42).</p><p>In 2021, he released his first album, a gospel music LP titled Company’s Comin’, which included collaborations with <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a>, <strong>Eddie Vedder</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Brandi Carlile</strong></a> and more.</p><p>Amid the pandemic, Jordan added TikTok sensation to his lengthy resume. He had over 2.3 million followers on the platform at the time of his death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In August, he shared a personal update with his social media followers: he made his first real estate purchase. “Well, guess where I am? I’m way up in the sky in a new condo that I just bought. Sixty-seven years old and I have my first condo,” he told viewers in a video via <a href=#>Instagram</a> at the time.</p><p>He added in the caption: “It’s never too late to be happy, y’all. I really did it. I bought my first piece of …………. property.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnaOhtqZ5yaipnZmeYrGmrcNmmK1lZmx6orLTnqlmm5GneqS%2BwKyfZpyVqa6quNJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lloyd-carney.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lloyd Carney</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./isaak-presley-age-parents-ethnicity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Isaak Presleys Age, Parents, Ethnicity, And Elvis Relation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
