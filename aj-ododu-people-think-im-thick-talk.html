It’s the show I was allowed as a child to stay up to watch every year!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pic1-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pic2-1.jpg><p>Showing off pictures of her outfit, she laughs. “I had to wear heels to get in the zone, even though you only could see my top half.”</p><p><a href=#>AJ</a>, who grew up in Blackburn, was thrilled to do it from Manchester — always keen to put the north on the map whenever she can.</p><p>“Viewers were saying: ‘Wow, she shouted out Salford and Manchester.’ It’s just a split second, but to feel seen in that moment is so important for people.</p><p>“They feel included in conversations that they don’t otherwise feel a part of.

Everyone just presumes that you’re thick and everything’s a joke — you’re desperately trying to be taken seriously.</p><p>“I remember telling someone I’ve got an English and politics degree and they were shocked: ‘Oh, you can read and write?’ People do judge a book by its cover — and the accent as well.</p><p>“All of the TV and media opportunities are in <a href=#>London</a>. I grew up in Blackburn in&nbsp;a working-class family who couldn’t even afford train tickets. I’d get on the coach, which would take 13 hours and cost £2, because that’s the only way you’re gonna get to London.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“Then there was figuring out how to stay in London to have work experience opportunities where you’re not getting paid. So before we even get to the accent, the colour of my skin, being female, it’s: ‘How do I get from A to B geographically?’</p><p>“Then it’s: ‘Oh, you’ve got this voice.’ And then there’s all of the micro-aggressions that are not spoken about. It’s been really difficult at times to navigate my way into the industry with a smile on my face.”</p><p>But she’s navigated it and then some.</p><p>“I never doubted myself,” she says. “That’s the thing that keeps me focused. I’ve no plan B — I have to be a TV presenter. And now it feels like all of my dreams are coming true at once and I am ready.&nbsp;</p><p>“I sincerely feel like I deserve to be here. I haven’t got lucky, I’ve really grafted. I always credit my whole family — my mum, dad and brothers and sisters [AJ has seven siblings] for backing me.”</p><p>AJ started her career as a reporter at BBC Lancashire, before <a href=#>moving to London</a>, where a TV executive encouraged her to soften her strong northern accent with elocution lessons.</p><p>She refused, and in June 2013 got her big break on Big Brother’s Bit On The Side with <a href=#>Rylan Clark</a> and <a href=#>Emma Willis</a>.</p><p>But her success was short-lived when her contract wasn’t renewed. How did she deal with what must have felt like a stop-start career at the beginning?</p><p>“It’s really interesting, because when I was presenting <a href=#>Big Brother’s Bit On The Side</a>, I was on a live TV show twice a week to millions of people and then I would go back to my dad’s flat in south London and sleep on his sofabed.</p><p>“In terms of the ups and downs of my career, I’ve felt extreme lows when I’ve been rejected. But when it’s all gone horribly wrong, I’ve gone back to work in a call centre or bar jobs. I’ve never been too proud to just get back to work.”</p><p>She quietly kept hustling away in the background — no job was too small — and her determination paid off.</p><p>After winning <a href=#>Celebrity Karaoke Club</a> on ITV2, she was chosen as the co-host for a one-off revival of The Big Breakfast last year and, of course, her unforgettable performances on <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a> made her a household name — at last.</p><p>Viewers were saying: ‘Wow, she shouted out Salford and Manchester.’ It’s just a split second, but to feel seen in that moment is so important for people. They feel included in conversations that they don’t otherwise feel a part of. TV shouldn’t be this really exclusive thing.</p><p>“There were tough lessons back then, but that made me realise I’ve just got to enjoy every single thing. I’m so glad that I don’t have to be on my dad’s sofa any more, struggling to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I was a little girl, I dreamt of these moments, so to see it happen is so exciting. I never see it as: ‘It’s only a small job.’ I think: ‘How fabulous I get to do all of the things that I dreamt of doing.’ I take none of it for granted.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SMF29MAYCONTENTS001.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SMF29MAYCOVER001.jpg><p>AJ grins: “It’s ironic, isn’t it, that sometimes the things that you feel insecure about are what make you. I’m glad I kept going. I thank god I haven’t got rid of my accent. To really dig deep and stay true to yourself is something that I’m really proud of.”</p><p>And it’s not just AJ’s family who encouraged her to stick with her dream — she’s found friends in fellow TV stars, who boost her when she’s filled with doubt.&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel lucky that I have peers that I can sincerely be myself around and not have to do the whole TV schmooze of pretending everything’s great.</p><p>“<a href=#>Tom Allen</a> is a great friend. We bonded over him going back to live with his parents in 2013, because that’s what I did. You feel like you’re going backwards when everyone else seems to be propelling forwards.</p><p>“I feel like Tom, Emma Willis, <a href=#>Joe Lycett</a> and <a href=#>Mo Gilligan</a> are people I can call on the phone and they’ll pick me up. I love seeing my friends shining in all avenues, because they do more for me than they probably even realise.”</p><p>Competing in last year’s Strictly with partner <a href=#>Kai Widdrington</a> is what gave her the chance to shine on a prime-time stage. Being part of the show is something AJ has wanted to do for years — and they actually turned her down to begin with.</p><p>“I asked them in 2020 if I could do it and they said no. There are always those people that get asked every year and say: ‘I just haven’t found the time.’ That was not me — I had not been asked every year!”</p><p>She believes that she made the Strictly gig happen with the power of manifestation.</p><p>“I really do manifest hard. I spoke it into existence to the point that it actually happened. At the beginning of 2021, I sat down with my agent and said: ‘I want to do Strictly Come Dancing. I have to do it.’ And I could see myself doing it.”</p><p>And she got the call. Despite never having had dance lessons (she wanted to but her parents couldn’t afford it), she won legions of fans — until her Glitterball fairy tale came crashing down when she was forced to pull out of the competition days before the grand final, after tearing a ligament in her foot.</p><p>When I was a little girl, I dreamt of these moments, so to see it happen is so exciting. I never see it as: ‘It’s only a small job.’ I think: ‘How fabulous I get to do all of the things that I dreamt of doing.’ I take none of it for granted.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine AJ ever not smiling or being upbeat, but she admits she was “really angry at my ankle” for getting injured.</p><p>“I was disappointed. And then I did a U-turn and thought: ‘You did what you needed to&nbsp;do. You got me as far as I needed to get.’” And for AJ, Strictly is now just an incredible memory.</p><p>“I was literally living the dream. Strictly was an overwhelmingly positive experience. It was the first time that I was introduced to a whole new audience of people who were accepting me for me — flaws and all. That felt really special.</p><p>“Ultimately, I was part of Strictly in the most inclusive year that has ever been. I feel really honoured to get to know Rose [Ayling-Ellis] and John [Whaite] and the whole cast. I feel like I’ve got a wider family now.</p><p>“And I feel really lucky, even though it didn’t end the way that I wanted it to, that I was able to learn to dance and be myself.”</p><p>There had been rumours that AJ and Kai had become more than dance partners, but after the show, he started dating fellow pro dancer Nadiya Bychkova. However, Kai still remains an important person in AJ’s life.</p><p>“I just spoke to Kai yesterday and he was like: ‘Oh my god, you smashed it on Eurovision.’ And that’s the beautiful thing — we’ll always have this really important and special bond where we got to go on this magical journey together. We really support each other and applaud each other.”</p><p>But while Kai might not be a romantic interest, AJ — who is currently single — is looking for love, despite a busy schedule.</p><p>“Oh my word, yes. I feel like there’s this presumption that I don’t have time to date, but I do. I’ve got time to see my friends, family and watch TV, so obviously I’ve got time to date.</p><p>“If I’m being honest, I’ve not made time to meet a new man. Do I want to go and meet&nbsp;a stranger in a bar right now or do I want to just see my friends? Oh, I’m gonna do that.</p><p>“My mum is so broody on my behalf… I’m trying not to succumb to the pressure from society and home [to get married and have babies]. I’d love to meet someone, though.”</p><p>In a bizarre way, injuring her ankle on Strictly worked out for the best, as it meant she couldn’t take part in the Strictly Tour, which freed up her diary to land a job presenting the second series of Channel 4 show The Bridge, in which two teams race to build a bridge to get to an island where £200K in cash is waiting.</p><p>I was literally living the dream. Strictly was an overwhelmingly positive experience. It was the first time that I was introduced to a whole new audience of people who were accepting me for me — flaws and all. That felt really special.</p><p>“It was perfect serendipity. We filmed it in Vietnam in January immediately after Strictly. It’s full of drama, jeopardy, adventure and a bit of humour. You’re gonna see a more serious side to me, too. I do the voiceover — I call it my posh documentary voice, which I’ve never even heard before.</p><p>“It’s a little bit David Attenborough! It felt quite empowering to be out there standing on my own two feet and hosting my own show. I am buzzing.”</p><p>Never content to sit on her laurels, AJ is already thinking of what she wants to achieve next. She’s been recruited by the BBC for the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations next weekend. “I’m going to be the roving reporter on Pall Mall as part of an amazing team of presenters. It’s gonna be fabulous.”&nbsp;</p><p>Contemplating what it must be like for her mother, an immigrant, to see her daughter achieve her dreams, she gets emotional: “With this accent, with my Nigerian parents, it’s just not what I could have ever imagined.”</p><p>When she’s not rubbing shoulders with the royals, she prefers to be with her family.</p><p>“I go back to Blackburn a lot. When I’m up north, I still share a bedroom with my younger sister in my mum’s tiny house.&nbsp;</p><p>I sleep on the top bunk. And I’m back to my chores! I see Blackburn as a holiday. The pace of life is slower and I’m with my mum and my friends, who know the real me. Chips and gravy, cups of tea and walks in the park.”</p><p>But if things go her way, she won’t have time for quite as many trips home. She’s set her sights on cracking America and has already made a start, as The Bridge is going to be shown Stateside on HBO Max.</p><p>“I used to have such a complex about my accent, but I just feel like I’m no longer going to put limitations on myself, because of the limitations that people set for me.</p><p>“I’ve got a list of things that I’d love to do. Sometimes that shocks people. Eurovision — absolute dream come true. CBeebies Bedtime Stories — I’d love to do that.</p><p>“I really wanna do Gardeners’ World. I’ve got massive palms, banana plants and a garden, but my grass is fake. It’s really good, because I can Hoover it — but only if I’m having a party.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“There are so many things that I want to do, but mainly, I just want to be happy.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>And she seems well on her way to achieving it.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The Bridge: Race To A Fortune, starts on Channel 4 and All 4 next month.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">IN THE MAKE-UP CHAIR WITH AJ</h3></p><p><strong>What are your skincare heroes?</strong></p><p>I use Dr Barbara Sturm — the Eye Cream, Moisturiser and Glow Drops are amazing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any make-up bag essentials?</strong></p><p>Mac Shape & Shade Brow Tint in Stud.
