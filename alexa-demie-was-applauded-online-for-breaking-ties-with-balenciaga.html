In one of the ad shots, the actress was seen standing on a snowy New York street in a black dress and a white bodysuit.&nbsp;Another shot shows her standing in the midst of a deserted desert while wearing a big, furry black coat and clutching a silver Balenciaga bag. The actress often donned Balenciaga clothes to red-carpet events and attended many shows held by the company.</p><p>Alexa Demie even wore a Balenciaga denim jumpsuit to the New York Stock Exchange for the brand‚Äôs 2023 runway presentation. The actress was hailed online for her choice to disassociate herself from the fashion company, with some followers pointing out how many celebrities failed to do so:&nbsp;&nbsp;Social media fans have long been dissatisfied with brand spokesperson Kim Kardashian‚Äôs reaction to the scandal. The reality star has been chastised for her slow reaction and for continuing to date Balenciaga after the incident.</p><h2>Twitter responds to Alexa Demie apparently separating herself from Balenciaga.</h2><p>Balenciaga stirred outrage last month when it launched an ad campaign for its Gift Shop line. The advertisement included photographs of youngsters carrying the brand‚Äôs plush bear handbags and posing in settings with BDSM and bondage-themed decorations.&nbsp;Another of their advertisements for the Spring 2023 campaign included a visual of a copy of a Supreme Court judgment on child pornography. Following the issue, the brand came under severe scrutiny, sparking mounting demands for a boycott.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alexa-Demie-1.jpg alt="Alexa Demie" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Social media users have also asked celebrities to break connections with the company due to its questionable behavior.
