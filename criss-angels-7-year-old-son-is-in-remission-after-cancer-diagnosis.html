What a journey it has been, this nightmare we have lived twice since 2015.”</p><p>Benson called Johnny’s “last cycles … tough,” noting that she <a href=#>gave birth to daughter Illusia</a>, now 2 months, during his three months of treatment.</p><p>“We have an amazing support system and I’m so so grateful for my parents and their selflessness. Family is everything, especially during the hard times,” the Jane star, who is also the mother of son Xristos, 2, concluded. “We are so proud of you my Johnny boy. This is ALL YOU. This chapter of your life will finally be behind you and I’m so excited for your future. I can’t wait to finally see you ring that bell my love. Ring it hard because the whole world is proud of you!”</p><p>Angel announced in December 2019 that <a href=#>Johnny had relapsed after battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> four years prior.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He got diagnosed with pediatric cancer before he was 2 years old, he’s been in treatment for over three years, <a href=#>he’s been in remission</a>, but unfortunately he had a relapse and he’s going back into the hospital on Monday,” the former Angeldust frontman told TMZ at the time.</p><p>The Mindfreak author <a href=#>spoke exclusively to Us Weekly </a>in 2016 about being an “optimistic” parent, explaining, “You always have to be positive. You always have to be focused on the good things. Life can throw challenges at you at any time and you never know what’s gonna happen and that’s what is life. It’s that you have to be positive and accept it as a journey, that it’s gonna have peaks and balance and that you’re always gonna persevere.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacqpmowG6tzaCcpatdbHq6scCrZKiklGLAsLqMoqpmoZ5iv6a5yKyqoqeeYq6nwMSrZJyZnpiys3nDopigpp%2BotrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./conal-gallen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Conal Gallen net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-applegate-nude-for-peta.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Applegate: Nude for PETA</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
