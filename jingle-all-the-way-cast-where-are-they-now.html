Jingle All the Way wasn’t a hit with critics when it was released in 1996, but it’s <a href=#>since become a cult classic</a>.</p><p>The holiday film starred <a href=#><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong></a> as Howard Langston, a workaholic dad who forgot to buy his son, Jamie (<strong>Jake Lloyd</strong>), the hottest toy on every kid’s Christmas list: Turbo Man. Along the way, Howard clashes with his overbearing neighbor (<a href=#>Phil Hartman</a>), a meddlesome police officer (Robert Conrad) and a postal worker named Myron Larabee (<a href=#><strong>Sinbad</strong></a>) who is searching for the same toy.</p><p>The movie also featured cameos from comedians including <strong>Jim Belushi</strong>, <strong>Laraine Newman</strong> and <strong>Chris Parnell</strong>, the latter of whom made his big-screen debut as a toy store clerk two years before he joined the cast of <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>.</p><p>While Jingle All the Way has <a href=#>become a perennial holiday favorite</a>, one of its stars still has some questions about the film’s plot. <a href=#><strong>Rita Wilson</strong></a>, who played Howard’s wife, Liz, doesn’t understand how her character failed to realize her husband was the person inside the life-size Turbo Man costume in the movie’s climactic parade scene.</p><p>“This is the movie that haunts me,” the Runaway Bride actress told <a href=#>Insider</a> in December 2020. “Why did my character not know that her husband, Howard, who talks like [Arnold Schwarzenegger] and is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, was Turbo Man. How did she not know that? Let’s see: He has an accent. He looks exactly like him. He’s wearing a half mask, but my character does not know. And it made me just feel like, ‘That’s just a little too stupid.'”</p><p>Schwarzenegger, for his part, seemingly looks back on the film with somewhat more fondness. “It’s still today the favorite Christmas movie that <a href=#>people are playing every single December</a>,” the former California governor told GQ in 2019. “This movie’s being played on television, and overseas, it also did extremely well.”</p><p>Though it’s now hard to imagine the movie with a different cast, Sinbad reportedly wasn’t the first person approached to play Myron. According to director<strong> Brian Levant</strong>, the studio wanted him to get <a href=#><strong>Danny DeVito</strong></a> for the role following his and Schwarzenegger’s hits Twins and Junior.</p><p>“They couldn’t convince DeVito to come onboard in the Sinbad role — apparently, DeVito read the script more carefully than Arnold and I,” Levant quipped to <a href=#>MEL Magazine</a> in January 2022. “I’ve also heard <a href=#><strong>Joe Pesci</strong></a> was considered, but I don’t believe that was the case. I think [producer] <strong>Chris Columbus</strong>’ connection with Pesci from <a href=#>Home Alone</a> is where that comes from.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sinbad said he “felt a vibe” that producers didn’t want him for the part, but during his audition, he accidentally dropped his script pages in a way that fit Myron perfectly. “I lost it, and then jumped on the table and started going off on Arnold. He freaked,” the comedian recalled during a 2019 interview on the “Blerd Empire” podcast. “[Then] I was walking through the lot and got a phone call: ‘Hey man, they loved you, come back.’ It was one of the strangest auditions I ever had.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see where the cast of Jingle All the Way is now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bftq%2Bzy55kmqScYsGpsYywmLJlk5bAtXnWoZyrnV2Wv6Z506GcsmWepMRw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bang-for-your-buck-best-spearmint-gum.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I tried five sugar-free chewing gums from Trident to Extra - an iconic brand delivered</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-jackson-pepsi-commercial-accident-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Jackson Pepsi Commercial Accident VIDEO</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
