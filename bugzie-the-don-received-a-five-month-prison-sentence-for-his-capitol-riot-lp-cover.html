The rapper will also serve a year on probation.&nbsp;The Capitol riots, which took place on January 6, 2021, in the United States Capitol Building in Washington, were carried out by Trump loyalists and claimed multiple lives.</p><p>According to WRIC, Bugzie took images both outside and inside the Capitol Building. Don Status Entertainment launched his album on March 4, 2021. The Virginia rapper was also allegedly photographed with monuments during the protests, which further exposed him and resulted in his arrest. Brodnax admits to being present in the Capitol on January 6, according to court records quoted by the Washington Post. He claimed, however, that he was just there to capture photos and movies for his song video.</p><h2>Bugzie The Don had already been convicted of possessing a weapon.</h2><p>Bugzie the Don has been charged with a crime on many occasions. According to reports, the artist was previously convicted of making a prohibited drug and having a handgun in Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp;Because of his past offenses, the Justice Department recommended that he serve 21 months in jail. The authorities also requested a longer term for the rapper because he erased images and videos from his phone that were evidence and had to be handed to the FBI.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bugzie-The-Don-2.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Variety, US District Judge Paul Friedman decided earlier this week that the rapper had wilfully hindered the administration of justice. The court also mentioned that Bugzie The Don has a history of failing to comply with constraints placed on him.</p><p>Mary Maguire, the artist’s lawyer, advocated for probation, citing the artist as a “wonderful community asset” and entrepreneur who founded his own clothing line and music business. His sentence was later reduced to five months in prison with a year of supervised release.</p><h2>The music career of Bugzie The Don</h2><p>Bugzie The Don is a Sandston, Virginia-based rapper.
