Suck it up. So, Artem and I actually got in this discussion,” Nikki, 36, told Us Weekly exclusively while promoting the new season of Total Bellas. “I think he was so shocked because I was like, ‘Why are <a href=#>you taking it so personal</a>?'”</p><p>She went on to explain to Chigvintsev, 38, that the judges are there to give constructive criticism to him and partner <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a> — specifically <a href=#><strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nikki-Bella-Told-Artem-to-Suck-It-Up-When-DWTS-Judges-Got-Tough-on-Him-1.jpg><p>“He was like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ Then you see what they got this past week,” she added, referring to the pair’s <a href=#>perfect score following their Argentine tango</a> on the Monday, November 9, episode. “I go, ‘She pushes you! You guys did better and look at the outcome.’ I’m like, ‘<a href=#>Carrie Ann’s doing her job</a>!'”</p><p>Nikki admitted that she and her husband-to-be, who welcomed their first son, Matteo, in July, “bumped heads on that.” She also urged the Russia native to make a video after Inaba, 52, revealed on The Talk she was <a href=#>getting “bullied” by fans</a> who thought her scoring was too tough. Ultimately, they decided not to post it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kaitlyn-Bristowe-Artem-Chigvintsev.jpg><p>“We <a href=#>saw things differently</a>, but that’s just the athlete in me,” the Incomparable coauthor said. “Imagine singing in front of <strong>Simon Cowell</strong>. Like, that’s kind of what you sign up for. … They would give me such a hard time every week. Like, ‘You need to be more graceful.’ And I just sucked it up. I was like, ‘Yeah, you’re probably right, I do.'”</p><p>Brie, 36, also noted that she would love to go on the show — if her husband, <strong>Bryan Danielson</strong>, would compete as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think it’d be fun to <a href=#>challenge myself if my husband</a> did it too, and we could kind of compete against each other,” the mother of two told Us.</p><p>Total Bellas premieres on E!
