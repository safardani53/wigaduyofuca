From quirky <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live</a> characters like Sally O’Malley (“I’m FIFty!”) to her serious turn as an overbearing socialite in HBO Max’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The White Lotus</a>, she’s proven over decades that she has range and talent in spades. The Cleveland, Ohio native has also enjoyed a high profile career in film over the years, including roles opposite <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></a> in How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000), opposite <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a> in Bad Teacher (2011), and has shown up as featured voice characters in multiple animated films.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>She’s also had a happy and successful home life. Molly married acclaimed artist <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fritz Chesnut</a> </strong>in May of 2004, and they’ve been married for almost two decades. She has since welcomed two children with him — a daughter and a son.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>But it turns out that, like so many comedians, her career was preceded by tragedy. Her mother (<strong>Mary Margaret “Peg” Shannon</strong>) and sister <strong>Katie</strong> were killed in a car accident when she was little, and she has referred to the tragedy and its influence on her multiple times throughout her career.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Here’s what to know about the sad events that led to the deaths of her mother and sister.</p><h2>It happened when she was only four years old.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Molly-Shannons-Tragic-Family-Car-Accident-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The accident occurred when <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Molly</a> was only four years old, around 1968.&nbsp; Worse still, she was actually in the tragic car crash — and she has shared her haunting memories of the moment that claimed her 33-year-old mother’s life. “The car was mangled badly on impact,” she wrote in her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 memoir, Hello, Molly! </a>“A man passing the scene stopped. My mother was lying on the ground beside our car and she asked him, ‘Where are my girls?’ She wanted to gather her three little girls and she couldn’t. Her heart must have broken in that moment. And those were her final words.”</p><h2>A cousin was also killed.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Along with her mother and three-year-old sister, Molly’s cousin was also lost in the accident. “My baby sister, Katie, and cousin <strong>Fran</strong> were killed instantly,” she wrote in Hello, Molly!&nbsp;The actress gut wrenchingly remembered being confused in the aftermath. “I didn’t know what death was,” she recalled. “I just wondered, ‘Why did Mommy and Katie leave without me? Maybe I’m bad.’ ”</p><h2>Molly suffered an injury in the accident.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Though Molly, her father<strong> James Francis Shannon,</strong> and her older sister Mary, (6 at the time) survived, Molly says they did sustain injuries. “Since Mary and I were in the very back of the station wagon, we just had a concussion and a broken arm, respectively,” she wrote in her memoir. “Katie was buried in the wreckage.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, her father was so badly injured in the wreck that he had to relearn how to do simple tasks, like walk. He was out of work for several years as a result of the incident.</p><h2>Her father was driving.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Molly-Shannons-Tragic-Family-Car-Accident-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>According to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wikipedia</a> page, Molly’s father was driving, and was under the influence when the accident occurred. He had been drinking after a party, and on the way home broadsided another vehicle, then slammed into a pole. But she holds no ill will, and even credits him for encouraging her in her Hollywood ambitions. &nbsp;“He was so positive and when I first went out to Hollywood, he was like, ‘Molly, you go into those Hollywood agents and managers, you doll yourself up, put on your high heels, march into those offices and you tell them, Hey, hold the phone. I’ve got talent.’ And he would say, ‘Use your singing voice.’&nbsp; So, that was his showbiz advice, and that is exactly what I did,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parade</a> in 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Ultimately, the entire experience would lead her to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>advocate for life insurance</a>, as well. “The accident changed our lives dramatically,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said in 2007</a>.&nbsp; “In an instant, my dad became a single parent and the only breadwinner for our family. Even at a young age, I was well aware of the financial and emotional stress he was under. People don’t like to think about bad things happening to them, but putting off the decision to deal with that possibility can have serious consequences.”</p><h2>The tragedy helped inspire her iconic character.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Molly shared in her memoir how the experience wound up <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>inspiring a character</a> that would all but define her career — Saturday Night Live‘s goofy “superstar” Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher. “Mary Katherine wants to be a star and she wants to be seen and she wants her mom to come back from the dead,” she wrote.&nbsp;“The character is a survivor… an adult child of an alcoholic. A girl who trips. But gets back up. It’s an emotional character. I wrote from my heart.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Mary Katherine was “really based on me,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Los Angeles Times</a> in 2022, “how I felt after the accident — really nervous, accident-prone, wanting to please, f*** up but full of hope. &nbsp;I just exaggerated everything I felt as a little girl and turned it into a character.” The beloved character of Mary Katherine also got her own spinoff movie, 1999’s&nbsp;Superstar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yoo6WxXai1orrNqKVmnpGitq3FjJyYq2WRmLCqsMSnq2ZtYGuGcoCWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-grande-to-2018-farwell-you-f-ck.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ariana Grande to 2018: Farewell, You F-ck!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kourtney-kardashian-shuts-down-son-masons-request-for-mcdonalds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kourtney Kardashian Shuts Down Son Mason's Request for McDonalds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
