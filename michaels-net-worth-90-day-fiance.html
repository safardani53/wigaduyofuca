And on 90 Day Fiancé, <a href=#>Michael Jessen proves just that</a>. He makes enough money to afford a lavish lifestyle and keep his Brazilian girlfriend, Juliana Custodio de Sousa, living comfortably herself, but what is Michael's net worth?</p><p>In a recent episode, he further proved that money is of no consequence to him when he dropped more than $4,000 on jewelry he planned to gift Juliana when she comes to the United States. Obviously, he's well off. It's all thanks to his lucrative career as a wine investor, which he showcased in the Season 7 premiere. It still makes you wonder, however, just how much money Michael is working with in order to provide so much for himself and others.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what is Michael's net worth on 90 Day Fiancé?</h2><p>Since Michael isn't an A-list celebrity, it's hard to determine his exact net worth. But on the 90 Day Fiancé Season 7 premiere, he made it clear that he is living large as a result of his own hard work. He was quick to show off his collection of sports cars and guitars, because apparently those are must-haves when you have a ton of disposable income. And he just purchased a new home to settle down in with his kids and Juliana.</p><p>The house is in Greenwich, CT, where the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">average real estate cost</a> is around $2 million and it's where his ex-wife and two children also live. It's very likely that he provides for them financially to some extent. He also flashed a swanky watch and his expensive cars, none of which he was too shy to brag about. Plus, he shares his credit and bank cards with Juliana. Although Michael's net worth outside of 90 Day Fiancé is hard to determine, he clearly isn't hurting for money.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Michael do for a living?</h2><p>It was explained in the season premiere that <a href=#><u>Michael is a wine investor</u></a>. According to Salary.com, an investor could make <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an average of $151,941</a><strong> </strong>per year. He worked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as a wine investor</a> for Zachy’s Wine Auctions for almost 10 years, so it's possible Michael made a lot more than that per year by the time he left the company.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Afterward, Michael landed a job as the president and CEO of Wally’s Auctions, a wine auction company. And, judging by the way he didn't flinch when he said Juliana had purchased a car with his credit card on 90 Day Fiancé, being the big boss at a wine auction company has treated him well financially. He makes enough money to party on yachts with celebrities, so clearly, Michael's net worth is up there, even if it's unclear exactly how much he is worth.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Juliana's job outside of the show:</h2><p>Hopefully, once Michael gets Juliana to the U.S. permanently, she will be able to fund some of their more extravagant lifestyle choices. She explained on the show that she's a model but, unlike others, she hasn't been given many opportunities to showcase her talents and land lucrative deals. She might be able to turn that around in the U.S., however, and if that happens, Michael might be able to keep some of his hundreds of thousands away for a rainy day. Maybe. Hopefully.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael and Juliana's relationship status after 90 Day Fiancé:</h2><p>In Touch recently reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Michael and Juliana got married</u></a> in October. An insider told the news outlet that Michael's ex-wife, who has appeared on the show this season, actually officiated the wedding, which took place at Michael's new Greenwich home. So not only did Juliana make it to the U.S., but she and Michael tied the knot and are likely still together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>While some 90 Day Fiancé fans might question Juliana's motives because of Michael's net worth, or his motives because of Juliana's much younger age, they might be one of the success stories of the season.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fiancé on Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo6xlnprBbsPOq6uhZWlleqWt2GadopmemLI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-wuhl-19511009-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Wuhl (Comedian) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-fishmans-wife-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Fishmans Wife: Who is Michael Fishman Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./whitney-cummings-unrecognizable-red-eyes-studio-666-premiere.html>Whitney Cummings looks unrecognizable with dark hair and RED eyes in creepy red carpet turn at Studi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-matt-czuchry-dating.html>Who is Matt Czuchry Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
