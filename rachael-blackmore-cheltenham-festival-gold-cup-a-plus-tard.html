He ran well in the race last year, he was only beaten a total of six lengths by State Man.&nbsp;</p><p>He is 4lb higher now than he was last year, but he goes into the race in good form.&nbsp;</p><p>He put up a very good performance last time in finishing third behind Gaelic Warrior in the big two-mile handicap hurdle at the Dublin Racing Festival at Leopardstown.&nbsp;</p><p>That form was obviously enhanced by Gaelic Warrior, who finished second in the Ballymore Hurdle on Wednesday, and by fourth-placed Anna Bunina, who finished second behind Queen’s Brook in a Grade 3 hurdle at Punchestown next time.&nbsp;</p><p>That was his first run since the Galway Hurdle, so hopefully he will come on for it.&nbsp; He goes well at Cheltenham and I hope that he can go well.</p><p><strong>2.50 – Hiddenvalley Lake</strong></p><p>The Albert Bartlett Hurdle is a race that could suit Hiddenvalley Lake.</p><p>He did well to win his maiden hurdle at Naas in November over two miles and three furlongs on his first run for Henry, and he improved on that a lot when he stepped up in trip for a Grade 3 race at Cork.</p><p>His stamina kicked in at Cork, he stayed on strongly from the second last flight to win well.&nbsp;</p><p>He was beaten last time in a Grade 3 hurdle at Clonmel, but the race wasn’t run to suit, and he was still only beaten a half a length by a good horse, his stable companion Monty’s Star, giving him weight.</p><p>Minella Indo was second behind Allaho in the same Clonmel race before he won the Albert Bartlett Hurdle, so I am hoping that history can be repeated.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a competitive race but I think this lad is a talented individual.</p><p><strong>3.30 – A Plus Tard</strong></p><p>I’m really looking forward to riding A Plus Tard again in the Gold Cup.</p><p>Last year was magic.&nbsp; To go so close on him in 2021, then to go back last year and for him to win it like he did, it was unbelievable.&nbsp; He found another gear up the run-in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/18-03-2022-jockey-rachael-799748858-1.jpg><p>His preparation this year has obviously not been ideal, but his work has been very good recently.&nbsp; He seems in great form.&nbsp;</p><p>I rode him out on Wednesday morning and he seems to have travelled over well.&nbsp; He seems in great order and it would be brilliant if he could win it again.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s very cool to be coming back here to ride the reigning Gold Cup title holder.</p><p><strong>4.50 – Magic Daze</strong></p><p>Magic Daze is stepping up to two and a half miles for the first time in the Mares’ Chase, but I am hopeful that she will stay.&nbsp; She won her point-to-point, and there is plenty of stamina in her pedigree.</p><p>She loves going forward, but she doesn’t burn herself out too much when she does.&nbsp; She finishes off her races strongly over two miles.&nbsp;</p><p>She was very good last time at Naas, she got into a lovely rhythm in front and she stayed on well up the hill to beat Dinoblue, and Dinoblue ran very well in the Grand Annual on Wednesday.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>This is a strong Mares’ Chase, but Magic Daze doesn’t have much to find with the top-rated mares on official ratings, and she goes into the race in good form.&nbsp;</p><p>She ran very well at Cheltenham too in the Mares’ Novices’ Hurdle a couple of seasons ago.&nbsp; She jumps well and if she relaxes for me, she has every chance of staying.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yg5Nqbm9rX6eupLTAnqNmmpyWsKy5zqucZpuYmrm1sc2hmKZllprAtbXVmqNmn5%2BhsW6v1KlkmmWgocK0edOaqZ1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-is-back-review-julia-roberts-shines-in-a-stirring-family-drama.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Ben Is Back' Review: Julia Roberts Shines in a 'Stirring' Family Drama</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nikki-bella-told-artem-chigvintsev-to-suck-it-up-on-dwts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nikki Bella Told Artem Chigvintsev to Suck It Up on 'DWTS'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jennette-mccurdy-nude-photo-leaks-does-she-want-us-to-see-this-o.html>Does She WANT Us to See This One?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fashion-designer-jessica-mcclintock-dies-at-90.html>Fashion Designer Jessica McClintock, Known for Her Romantic Dresses, Dies at 90</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilana-wiles-19741124-html.html>Ilana Wiles (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp;
