And when you rely on a piece of tech to behave the way it's intended to every single time you interact with it, it can get really, really frustrating whenever it seemingly craps out on you.</p><p>Like when <a href=#>Instagram</a> stories seemingly out of nowhere are not showing up on the application.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stories not showing up on Instagram: How to fix.</h2><p>With a massively popular social media application like Instagram that is always connected to the internet, with teams/throngs of people working on it around the clock, it's only a matter of time before the app runs into some issues.</p><p>It isn't easy ensuring that a piece of software is not only consistently reliable, but works on a variety of different devices, web browsers, and operating systems. And while there are some errors on Instagram's back end that could result in a hindered experience for the end user, there are some factors one should look into before shaking their fist at the sky and cursing Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>One telltale sign that Instagram stories aren't loading for you is that dreaded "spin cycle" icon. That rotating circle that seemingly never stops churning is a true pain in the patoot. Sometimes, stories just take a little longer to load because your internet connection is spotty, or you've gone over your allotment of data/high-speed data.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So the first course of action is to check your data connection and make sure that other applications/services on your phone that are contingent upon an active internet connection for usage are working.</p><p>Another weird setting you should check is to make sure that the actual date/time settings on your phone are set to automatically get times from your cellular network provider, aka "auto" mode.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone else’s Instagram stories not showing up?

You may need to dig into your phone's app settings and "Force Stop" the application.
