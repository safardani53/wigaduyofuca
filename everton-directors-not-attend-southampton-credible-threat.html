manhandled" by a fan.</p><p>Reporter Juliette Ferrington said that the chief executive was subjected to "misogynist, sexist and threatening language used against her".</p><p>However, the <a

Graeme Sharp are said to have "reluctantly accepted" and will not be at the game today.</p><p>The advice came after the club is said to have received "unacceptably threatening
