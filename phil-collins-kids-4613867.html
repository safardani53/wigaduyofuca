He was born on September 14, 1976 in London, England, but moved to Vancouver when he was 8. Simon joined his father on tour with Genesis, which inspired him to follow in Phil’s footsteps and pursue a career in the music industry. He was signed to Warner Music and moved to Germany, where he released his debut album All of Who You Are. It included the singles “Pride,” “Money Maker,” and “Shrine Through.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Simon later left Warner Music and started his own record label, Lightyears Music.

They released their debut album,&nbsp;Dimensionaut, in 2013. Simon eventually left the group in 2018 and focused his attention back on his solo career.</p><h2><span><span>Lily Collins</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lily-collins-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Phil’s third child, and only kid with his second wife, Jill Tavelman, is daughter&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lily Collins</strong></a>. Lily, who was born on March 18, 1989, in England, is the most famous of Phil’s children. She is a successful actress who began her career at age 2 in the BBC show Growing Pains. Her breakthrough performance was in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a>‘s 2009 movie&nbsp;The Blind Side. Lily went on to star in the films&nbsp;Priest,&nbsp;Abduction,&nbsp;Mirror&nbsp;<i>Mirror</i>,&nbsp;Stuck in Love,&nbsp;Love, Rosie, and&nbsp;Rules Don’t Apply, which earned her a Golden Globe nomination in 2016. More recent movies she’s appeared in include&nbsp;<i>Extremely, Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</i>,&nbsp;Tolkien, and&nbsp;Mank.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>To most fans, Lily is best known for her work in Netflix’s comedy-drama series&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emily in Paris</a>, which premiered in October 2020. Lily stars as Emily Cooper, an American marketing executive who moves to Paris for a new job. Lily earned a second Golden Globe nomination for&nbsp;Emily in Paris. The series was also nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series at the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2021 Emmy Awards</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Lily <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> in September 2021 to film director <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Charlie McDowell</strong></a>, who is the son of actors <strong>Malcolm McDowell</strong> and <strong>Mary Steenburgen</strong>. Lily had a difficult relationship with her dad growing up, but they eventually mended fences. She penned an emotional letter to Phil in her 2017 book&nbsp;Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me,&nbsp;in which she revealed she developed an eating disorder from insecurities stemming from issues with her father. “I&nbsp;forgive you for not always being there when I needed and for not being the dad I expected,” Lily <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote in her book</a>. “I forgive the mistakes you made. There’s still so much time to move forward. And I want to. I’m inviting you to join me. I love you with all of my heart, more than you’ll ever know, and am so thankful for you. I’ll always be your little girl.”</p><h2><span><span>Nicholas Collins</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/nicholas-collins-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nicholas Collins</strong></a> (b. 2001) is Phil’s fourth child. He is the son of Swiss translator Orianne Cevey, who was married to Phil from 1999 to 2006. Nicholas has become a drummer and even joined his father on stage at the age of 15 to perform “In the Air Tonight.” He told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;in 2017, “I’ve been really exposed to my father’s music my entire life, so it’s second nature. But it’s completely different when you know the song as compared to when you’re actually playing it. At first, I listened to the live versions they’ve done on the most recent tours and then listened to the studio versions. It’s different to hear how my dad did it compared to what another drummer did [in concert], so obviously I want to be like what he did since he’s the one that played the song and wrote the actual drum part.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Due to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>health issues</a>, Phil is no longer able to sing and play the drums for Genesis on tour. However, Nicholas has stepped in and performed in his father’s place for the band’s ongoing&nbsp;The Last Domino? Tour, which is expected to conclude in March 2022. Nicholas also has his own band called&nbsp;<strong>Better Strangers</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Most recently, Nic opened opened up about his dad’s ongoing health issues during a 2022 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>. “I think at the moment, he’s definitely retired,” he said at the time. “If you ask me on a serious level, I think that show in London was my dad’s last show. But then again, he said that in 2004 and we wound up doing a tour in 2018. You can never be sure. But I also do think that my dad is probably excited about the next step in his life. Music has given him so much, but he’s also given so much to it. His career has pretty much determined his life for the past 50 years. I think for him to be able to take a step back and not have that pressure that he’s had for decades, I think, is going to be nice for him. For me, I think that was that, but who knows?”</p><h2><span><span>Matthew Collins</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Matthew-collins-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Matthew Collins </strong>(b. 2004) is Phil’s youngest child.
