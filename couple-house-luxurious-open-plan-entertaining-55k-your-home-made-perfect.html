It's quite hard what we want to do with our house."</p><p>And with their relatively small budget of £55,000 - the couple were at war over to knock down all the internal walls or to try and transform the space they had to get what they want.</p><p>"I think that's why we're not moving forward with any of our place," Esther added. "We've not reached a happy medium of what we both want. Andy has impulsive ideas, and I'm more devil's advocate."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-16-at-20.19.03.png><p>Entering into the world of virtual reality, despite their previous lack of agreement, the couple instantly fell in love with an open-plan design by award winning architect Robert.</p><p>The ambitious design involved knocking down walls, building an extension, adding large windows and even moving the front door to achieve the space they wanted.</p><p>But the couple were worried the project could quickly run over budget and, when finished, may be impractical for their three young children.<br>"It's a really ambitious project so of course I am worried about that," Andy admitted. "But all the things we wanted for the house are in this space."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final_17952104_17952094.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Andy-and-Esther-Pic-90.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Andy-and-Esther-Pic-110.jpg><p>Esther agreed: "It's so different to what our house was and how lots of houses are. Normally you know what each room does, but this is so versatile so I'm apprehensive as to how our family will fill it."</p><p>But the couple had no reason to worry, as their dream home was finished with four-and-a-half months exactly as they'd seen, only changing the plan slightly to alter the wooden floor colour and bring in their own old sofas.</p><p>Andy said of the finished home, unrecognisable from the original house: "We're over the moon. There are so many different ways to enjoy our space."</p><p>They even installed a projector in the ceiling to replace the old TV, which descends from the ceiling with the click of a button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final_17952143_17952133.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in fabulous</h2></p><p>"We're so glad that we went with it" Andy admitted, with Esther adding: "It's just so different. Nobody has anything like it."</p><p>But their home did come at a cost, going over budget by £13k - spending £7,000 on the re-purposed wood floors alone.</p><p>"We held on to our vision and we don't regret it now we're in this place," Andy concluded.</p><p><strong>The next episode BBC Two's Your Home Made Perfect airs next Tuesday at </strong>9pm<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5dxbm1rYWl8pLvUqaOeZZikwrSxjKWssa2inry2v4yop56mXaW5orqMnqWtnaKprqq6yKeeZm1loHq6u9SrZKGnnZp6rq3DnmSpnaKbsqTAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./detlef-schrempf.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Detlef Schrempf</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./confessions-of-a-teenage-drama-queen-cast-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where's the 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' Now?
